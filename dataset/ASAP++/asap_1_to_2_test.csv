4,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail ""@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not posible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you amagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most buissness, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the castomer's convinence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her resturant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 wer not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there.",5,4,5,4,4
8,1,"@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the feild? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. Hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there."" said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never!""",6,5,5,5,4
11,1,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 people acknowledge the great advances that computers give us, but they also put us at @CAPS1 disadvantages. Computers have been known to help develop health issues. As people become more intune with the online world, they tend to interact with their family less. Don't forget the danger of online predators - they're deadly. @CAPS1 people who do nothing, but watch television are often refered to as cauch potatoes. Those who are glued to their computer screens are no better. It is stated by numerous of @LOCATION2's top doctors that too much time spent on the computer can cause damage to your health. Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm. They can submerge themselves into obesity. This often causes depression as it begins to sink in. Addition itself is a serious health issue. I wouldn't be surprised if they add a computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future. These problems are slowly spreading and we must come together to abolish them! Family time is an treasured value, to the @CAPS2 people, but lately, computers are ruining this tradition. With so @CAPS1 people absorbed with online drama, friends, and even video games, family interaction is declining. People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace. They @MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat, scarcely resting. This can cause great tension or sorrow in @CAPS1 families. Who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever. Your children could be talking to someone they believe is another teenager looking for a friend to console in when, really, they are a forty-year-old serial killer waiting to find the right time to attack. Studies show that one fourth of online users have had an encounter with a dangerous person.",5,5,5,4,5
24,1,"Dear local newspaper, I've heard that not many people think computers benefit society. I disagree with that. Computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foregin places, and allow people to communicate with others online. Some people were basically born with hand-eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand-eye coordination has gone up! ""On average, computers can increase a persons hand-eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1 says @PERSON2. Think of it, just by learning to tye, your hand-eye coordination can go up @PERCENT1.! That's amazing! Having good hand-eye coordination will get you far in life, and helps with small, everyday things such as playing an instrument, or doing household chores. It also helps in sports. You need good hand-eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim. If more people spend more time on the computer, then the population's hand-eye coordination would increase, and who wouldn't want thats. Have you ever heard of @LOCATION1? It is a country in @LOCATION2 that no one really knows much about. By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge, and will make us more of people around the world. This can improve our travel. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. We @MONTH1 also learn about their traditions, and culture. ""The internet gives us access to the world,"" says @PERSON1, ""we can learn so many new things that will make us more of people, countries, and the environment."" @CAPS1 is right, we can also be aware of the environment. Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how o preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips! In a recent study @PERCENT2 of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 can keep your social life in tact, and can even reunite yu with old friends. For example, @CAPS2 suggest family. You can keep in touch wih many people trough @CAPS2! Also, you can make new friends. Most teens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Sites like @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. I once talked with someone on @CAPS7 for over an hour! We found that we both have @CAPS4 accounts and keep in touch there! This also helps you gain confidence because you @MONTH1 have the courage to say something over the computer that you would't say real life. The computer can really amp up your social life. As you can see. computers don't just ""your barain,"" they imprdove hand-eye coordination, help you learn about far away places, and improve your social life by allowing you to talk to others. Computers benefit the society more than anymore will ever know!",4,5,4,4,4
25,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 off, I beileve that computers are very helpfull to many people by looking up information, or talking to friends. Although many kids should be spending their time outside, the computer is a well-occupied environment that helps kids learn and interact with others. I believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire. Although, they should always make time go outside, hang out with friends, ect. The computer @MONTH1 be fun but its always important to get outside and enjoy nature. Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health. If a child gets addicted to the computer it will affect how he interacts with other and @MONTH1 do serious damage to their brain. Although, I believe children should have the right on the computer, it's always important to spend time outside enjoying nature. Another reason why I think children should have the right to the computer is because of the information they learn and discover. Many kids grow up to have a career in computer makings or program designing. Some kids @MONTH1 have their education online or to teach others. The computer is a non-stop generation of intelligence based to help people learn, play and discover. Many people have dream to one day build a computer or make new programs. All students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends. Everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing. I do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how other think of them.",3,3,4,4,4
30,1,"Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. Computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. Computers make work easier and neater. Typing is often faster than writing, and is always easier to read. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to @PERCENT1 more free time to do whatever they want. Computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. If you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer. So you don't have to figure it out yourself. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational. Even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. @PERCENT2 of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work. I hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society.",4,4,3,4,4
32,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society of all! In @CAPS1 opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are @CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows @CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms who knows @CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms. Children need to be careful about @CAPS3 they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. Were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice @CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take this kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last @DATE2 when I went to @CAPS1 cousins house. @CAPS1 aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and enjoy the environment. @CAPS1 last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know @CAPS3 your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging call them. Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. That reminds me of @CAPS1 sister. When I get home, she will normally be on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""@CAPS3's up?"" or ""@CAPS4 was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly @ORGANIZATION1. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. So @CAPS3 are you going to do about it?",5,4,5,5,5
38,1,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one.",3,3,3,4,4

43,1,"The effect of people using computers isn't anything bad couse you learn a lot from it. In some ways when you use the computer and you type, the typing exercises your fingers. Your fingers will get muscle and will teach you to remember where to type without looking down on the keyboard. People sometimes using computer is good because if your writing letters you don't have to use pencil you can just type it and print. The typing does all the work for you so you won't spend hours writing to someone. Computers are helpful to people for example, ir your researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1 you can find almost all the information on the computer in a instant click. Computers save time and does a lot of work. Computers are helpful piece of technology and one of the best.",2,2,2,3,3
47,1,"Dear newspaper, I feel as though internet or computers act as an advantage in sosiety rather than a problem. They help with school work, like projects or email. You can even take college online now! People also use the internet for media or to simply catch up with friends. One of the most important reasons to have a computer is for school orenented reasons. Like having a project that you need to get notes for or making a power poin presentation. One other great reson is for the teachers. There computers can help them teach a class in a way that is both fun and easy to undersand. The new uprizing in computer use has brought about new ways of getting a college degree. Now you even just simply get in bed turn on your lap top and take college classes right on your computer! I dont know about you guy's but I'd much rather take college in the own comfort of my home then drive to a campus all the time. Another great use for the internet is e-mail to e-mail makes our lives a lot easier now that more people use it. It can send us school starts like a early dismiste or a way to catch up with old highschool frends. Another great reson for the internet is for mention or just to have fun and relax. @PERCENT1 of people that have computers use them for media or fun reasons, like gamelry, or to go on to youtube. Please add this article into your news paper so that the computer can be put out there as a helping add, and not something that is going to make the whole world obise because thats not just from computers. Its the people who use computers, felt that they dont get exercise not the computers. So why put them out in a bad way.",4,3,3,3,3
51,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered how to get somewhere and you didn't have a map or @CAPS1 near you and the only thing that was the near you was a @CAPS3. Well I am saying you should go on it and search were you want to go. Computers are very helpful in every one's daily life they have so many facts and interesting things on them, @CAPS2 about again trying to figure out were someone lives it's very easy, go on google and type in someones's adress and there you go. The @CAPS3 is also very good because have you ever thought about one of your friends or a special someone and you havent seen them in like a really long time and you miss them well no problem mostley all computers have some sort of camera in them were you could video chat or just chat regular on the enternet. That is very helpful because even though you could just go on the phone and call them it's better to do it online because how about if you havent seen them you want to see a picture of them they could just send it to you on some sort of chat page or just your email. It is so much better then mailing one picture in the mail and it takes days for the mail to come if you could do it the faster way on line and on video chat it will be better.. The @CAPS3 is also very helpful because how about one day you want to go some were and you dont know what the weather is going to be well you could go to put on the tv and see but there is so many communications and you cant really see because they move the weather days fast. On the @CAPS3 you could type the weather in for one week and it will tell you and you could look at it for as long as you want and it will stay there so you could see the whole week without the screen having fast as the image is not in the light light or if it's to dark. The @CAPS3 is so helpful. People do say that it is good to get off the @CAPS3 and go for a walk outside in nature I do agree with that but people and children do get their exercising by walking around the house and going outside going shopping. Computers are helpful and nice and another thing is say one day you are online and you are looking at clothes or shoes and you want to buy them but you dont want to go to the mall a half hour away from were you live you could just buy them online and they will be shipped to your house and you dont even have to lift a fingure. They are also good because they have like a dictionary on it were if you dont know how to spell a word you type it in the best way you can and it corrects your spelling and tells you what the word is, also the computers have pictures of everything, if you want to see how something looks like you can type it in and shows you. with all the facts I have given you I hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful nice and safe.",3,4,3,4,4
60,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I, agree that computers are benefits society. The computers have positive effect on people like hand-eye coordination.

62,1,"I think it is okay for people to use computers because they get to learn new things and meet new people. I don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs works on computers all day. @NUM1 each sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. I think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people. Slick, slack, slick, thats the sound of people typing ont he computer and meeting new friends and having a good time. When you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house. You get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world. I dont think its a bad idea to use computers because some peole who have jobs work on computers all day. I think people who uses computers all day while the're at work dont have to be classy, topuler or trendy, they just working to help themselves and theior family.

They can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored. i remember the time when I was bored and I went on the computer to google who @PERSON1 was and I found out she was a famous sinher, someone I didn't know but heard about.

65,1,"Dear Newspaper, People are spending way too much time on the computer and it is not right. They should be excercising, and interacting with friends and family. Having a computer also distracts them from schoolwork. Computers normally have effects like this on the people that use them. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1 people should be out getting exercise. The @LOCATION1 is one of the coubtries with the most overweight people. Many teenagers are inside all @DATE1 at the computer waiting for their friends screename to pop up so they can talk to them. They don't need to be completely gone, but while they're waiting for their friend they could be exercising. All they need to do is put on some fun music and start dancing around, that will get them the excercise they need for the @DATE1. They also could do ten pushups and twenty curlups, or even more if they wanted to. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1 exercise. Having a computer effects the owner because they don't have a lot of face-to-face converstions with friends and family. You can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead. If they can be at home on the computer for hours then they probably can hang out in real life. Instead of videochatting with your cousins in another state, lan for them to come visit you guys one @DATE1. That way you can actually talk to them and see what they're doing to. You could also play board games, hide and seek, etc. It is much more fun to be with someone in real life, then to talk with them online. The last but deffidently not least effect that computers have on peoples lives is it distracts them from school. Once you start talking with one of your friends, it's pretty hard to stop. Many people don't know how to stop so they don't do the homework they were supposed to do, or they didn't study for the big test the @DATE1, therefore they end up failing it. Some kids will do homework and a on the computer at the same time, the homework is probably wrong because they weren't concentrating on it hard enough. Having a computer effects your life in many different ways, some positive and some negative. Some ways are it ""stops"" you from exercising, it doesn't let you have face-to-face interaction with friends and family and it distracts many kids from school.",4,4,4,4,4
69,1,"Some people think it is a good idea and same do not. My opinion is that, I think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons. Here are three reasons why, @NUM1. grownups working, @NUM2. students learning how to type, and @NUM3. communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer. For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say. And in person, you can't. Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion. I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, playgames, no sites, and many more other things to go on, only if you have a computer at home.",4,3,3,4,4
71,1,"Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computers scientist have found cures for desesse, jobs have become easier . I believe that computers have a baseline effect on people. Because they educate people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to people having to pay for anything. If someone to a country that they have they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do @CAPS1 go to a website that could help them find affordable . If a child @CAPS1 doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 thay can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about about places all over the world, you can go on a website that has videos and written sheet clips about what has been goin on around the world and learn about current events. My grandmother would tell me stories about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 before they had computers, now my dad works on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and he tells me stories about his day. when you compair the two different decades it saids like computers help out a lot within @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Before computers stores would have to do math in their pad when they were giving change back to people, now people save by punching in the numbers in the computer. I think the computers have helped people with their jobs. When you talk on the phone to someone it costs you money. When you just want to see someone I'l costs you money to get on a phone . with computers you can , or onstant message people with any costs. If you want to see a friend for her @CAPS9 but dont have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to open it up and now computers can be as big as a flat @CAPS10 and can turn them on with just a push on a button,, Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?",4,4,4,4,4
75,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the past ten years, advances in technology have completely changed the world. Technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world. More jobs are created and help speed up ordinary events such as taxes, messages, news, and teaching. However, many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet. In this addiction many people can lose time with their family, time to exercise and enjoy nature. Since being part of the generation growing up in the new technology era, I have had a first hand experience with the benifits of the new technology. I believe that this technology is a great help to society today. Many more jobs are being created because of this technology. For example, think about how many people could be employed if a new computer system was created. There would be thousands of people working on many things such as the founder, manager, creater of new ideas or just working at the new companies retail store. Running a business or a corporation is a very difficult job to do. But because of the advances in technology, running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted. With the new technology, people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out memos. Also for businesses, their stocks of the company can be updated every minute. These advances will make easier to run and make them more efficent. With the advances in technology average people can be updated on the new around the world every minute. Also when it comes time to pay taxes, fill them out and pay on line. None the less, there is more entertainment open to everyone. Through todays new technology, peoples lives are made much easier. They can work faster, get more arrands accomplished, learn more, connect to people around the world, and be caught up with local and international news.

Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet effects your everyday life in a good way.",3,4,3,3,3
83,1,"Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some cridit insted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic.",3,3,3,3,2
93,1,"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well informed of the benifets of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is esencial to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computers users have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to ""@CAPS2 to learn"", a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users. Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved. The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governers, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites are also immensly popular, and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't lie relative vincinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help town in countless ways and ""@CAPS5 @CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this.",4,4,4,4,4
95,1,"Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they effect us in a posotive way. Computers can help us explore far away places that we @MONTH1 never go to. Maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homeworks. One reason why I think computers are only helping us is they help us explore othe places. I know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. But not at all of us can afford to travel far away. Most families however, do have computers. With these computers, kids with a parents permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place.

If you are like me, you like to talk to your friends. A @CAPS5! But sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. A solution a new wonderful machine called. The @CAPS6! You can chat long distances without being for it. This is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @LOCATION2. I thoughy I would never talk to him again. Then I learned about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. It allows you to talk whenever you want, whenever you want! Now, me and my friend can stay in touch and @CAPS4 can you! My finale reason as to why I think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. Even have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? How about the capital of a state that visit, slipped your mined? Well the @CAPS6 can solve both of those problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator. For the other @PERCENT1 you can download and install softwear onto your @CAPS6 for a low price. And every @CAPS6 made in this world has internet capabilities. All's you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride! @CAPS4 don'y worry about too much @CAPS6 use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. @CAPS4 remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. they also help us connect with no another, and help us excel in school. @CAPS4 get on, and get goin.

99,1,"Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should stop using Computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, bad for the younger kids, and teens could be, talking to someone they don't know. Lexi @NUM1, says that ""she has goting facebook texts to her cell phone of other teenage kids that are excuset"". @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population teenagers have @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 chat.

106,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to today's society. Not only do computers help us connect with peopl, but think of how efficiant they can be. And you can't neglect the fact that computers offer a profusion of entertainment. So before you say, ""Computers are ruining our society."", please read my reasons why computers are essential. What is the first thing that comes to mind when I you hear 'computers'. Many people think of the chatrooms and @CAPS2's. Those are two examples of how a computer can bring people together. Imagine you doing a report on life in @LOCATION1. However, all you can find are those generic articles in old books. A simple solution is talking online to an actual person who lives in @LOCATION1. Computers can even help connect family members who live long distances from each other. I know that i would be overflowing with bliss if an aunt or uncle contacted me through '@CAPS3' or e-mail. In addition to connecting with people, computers are very efficiant. As students mature, homework is taken seriously. For instance, one of my friends handed in an essay and our teacher did not accept it. Her penmenship was not legible. Typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy, unsophisticated work. The efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks. Just imagine how often you'd get lost without your directions from. Or how much you'd mess up if you didn't print out a recipe for dinner. Most importantly, computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment. Whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is you game; a computer will suit you. There are. Thousand of website to visit and even more games just waiting to be played. A computer is anyone's passport to leisure and enjoyments. So you make the choice. Is a computer going to benefit society, or will they have catastrophic results. I urge you to remember; computer are a way to connect with people and they are efficiant. Most of all, remember how much you can achieve with a computer.",6,5,5,5,5
110,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good to society, because you can read the news paper online, email your friends and family, and can play games and watch videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important, news paper are okay but you have to pay for them with the news paper online you can get the latest news for free! This way you can save money and trees. Heres another way of saving trees. E-mailing is a good to talk so some one far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. E-mail is also good for e-mailing links to cool websites, on e-mail can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, Computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on game sites, watch videos or movies or play on online game on just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bore I go on my computer and I can always find something to don on line or find a movie to watch. So, computers are very popular, in many areas computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are",3,3,3,4,4
113,1,"Dear @CAPS1 paper, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I am writing this letter on the count of the computer issue. @CAPS2 look on this subject is the oppisite. People @MONTH1 spend more time on the computer then exercising, but theycould still be social in chat rooms. People can use laptops out doors. You can spread your imagination with the games you can play. Lets get onto @CAPS2 first point, being social. The experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer. They @MONTH1 be spending less time with there friend and family physicly, but who said there not being social. Theres facebook, @CAPS3, and chat rooms. You can talk to your friend on there so they on being social. Not being physicly social but verbily social. On to @CAPS2 next subject the expert say were not enjoying out doors, but the over looked something here it is. If were not enjoying outdoors then half of amarica would be as plae as can be. Then theres laptops. You can use thoughs out doors. People that have laptops can go outside on a sunny day grab some fruit and relax. You could stay out there till the batterie deis. Then just grab the pluge and keep relaxing its easy. Computers also help your imagination. Some computer games help expand your imagination because when your playing games you think of things that could make the game better. Simulaters help you design or even controll things. Some games allow you design and play as a character you created. They help you jobs that you might be intrested in. For me computer games expanded @CAPS2 drawing. All these thing can be reversed. No one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again. Humanity has the power to get off the computer, and go outside or be social.

131,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are beginning to be a problem in many households. I feel that too many people are becoming addicted to computers. People like this are more likely to gain weight, have little social time, and spend too much time inside. In @CAPS6 article I have recently read in the @ORGANIZATION1, it was about @CAPS6 experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor stated that his findings showed that people who are addicted to computers only leave their homes to run errands. When this happens, it interferes with their lives as well as their bodies, because our bodies need sunlight. Furthermore, his study also showed that people who go outside more and not on the computer as much tend to be happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients started to be more joyful once they stopped going on the computer as often. I like when the people around me are happy, not grouchy, don't you? I have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight. These are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday. This is very bad for your health and body. If someone sits at their computer all day eating the food is not being worked off, so it all turn to fat. Moreover, statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies this way, they could end up with some type of condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 intervied @NUM2 year old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he got a @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2, or any of his other friends. In addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become less social with friends and other people like parents, teachers, and more. When people push aside their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large portion of their life. This can be stopped if parents put their foot down, set limits, and make kids spend more time outside. As you can clearly see, computers @MONTH1 have some benefits, but they have many disadvantages. Addicted compuer users become less social, they don't go outside and start to ""pack on the pounds."" @CAPS6 effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight.",5,5,4,5,5

Computers @CAPS7 allow easy access to the news and online textbooks which provides an enourmous amount of benifits to today's society.

Primarily, computers are used for typing, editing and presenting as stated before, local newpaper are required to use computers to present their work.

I think this @CAPS6 messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers @CAPS6 messing people up @CAPS6 because of the impformation that @CAPS6 on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This @CAPS6 ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people @CAPS6 the dangerous chat rooms. This @CAPS6 not good because your not familliar with the person your talking too. The person could have posed as another person and be very hipocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasent. Like you might give them you number, adress, @CAPS2 personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, @CAPS2 ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that @CAPS6 given to thousands of people online. Another words the""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" @CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" @CAPS9 these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on.",3,3,3,3,3
186,1,"Dear, Newspaper I am writing to persuade to put article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people. Computers make you unhealthy, bullying takes place on the computer, and it effects how you do in school. First, computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy. I say this because most people don't get enough exercise. Then you get obese from not having enoughb exercise. Eventually you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not get diabetes from being obese, but most of the time you do. The next reason why lcomputer have bad effects is because kids get bullied on the internet. This is important because when kids get bullied the feel bad about themselves. Then they all get very depressed. This is called cyber bullying. One example is, is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son. his son had killed himself from being bullied on the internent and at school. That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people. My third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school. they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes. Also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer. Kids also do bad in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out. It is a proven fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have dropped out of school was kids that were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time. Thats how a computers have on effect on school. Now remember, computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy. People gets bullied, and it has on effect on your schoolwork. That is how computers have bad effects on people.",4,4,3,3,3
188,1,"Dear local Newspaper, Some people say computers have negative affects on family and friend others say computers are an important aspect of society. I would have to agree with the second group of people. Computers help students research information that they @MONTH1 need for school. People can talk to there friends on things like facebook or @CAPS1 and you can write a rough draft on the computer save it then go back to it and make the final changes from a draft to a final. I will elaborate in the following three paragraphs. Computers are a quick and easy way to look up information for a school project or paper. I can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time but so would a book. A book would probably take up more time and you @MONTH1 get less information. For example the book could be about multiple people and you read the entire thing only to get two sentences of information. Another reason computer reasearch is quicker is that you can go from one page get some information and then once you have gotten all the information from that page but you still need more you can just click another link. If people didn't have computers they would have to go to the library and spend time looking them. Is it worth it to use all that time. People can talk to there friends on facebook or @CAPS1. Some people say computers distract you from friends when really they help you talk to your friends more. What if your on vacation and your so tired of seeing and talking to your family because you've been with them non stop for a week and you miss your friends. All you have to do id turn on the computer and then you have an intent link to them. Chat rooms also help you meet other people your age from the next town over on enywhere in the country. They @MONTH1 even became your new best friend. When you write a paper do you want to have to write it once then go back and write it @NUM1 more times? Theres a much simpler way it's called a computer. You can write your first draft then all you have to do inordre to get a final copy is reread it and make changes when they are nessecary. Computers also help kids spell better. All they have to do is hit a button.",4,4,4,4,4
204,1,"You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question noone in your home can answer. Why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Of course once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't @CAPS3 what to do. Simple, all you have to do is reasearch it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over @PERCENT1 of jobs out in the world relie on the technology of a computer. For example the @ORGANIZATION1 job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do? There are some lawyers incart who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying. Did you @CAPS3 that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is @CAPS4. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget @CAPS5. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be @CAPS6 @CAPS7. That game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain. Strategy come in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?",4,4,4,4,4
212,1,"I think that people are spending a lot of time on there computers and not enjoying nature and things. My reasons are that people don't do anything except surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and they site around eating junk and no exercise. Those are my three reasons. My first reason is people do is surf the web. There is over a million websites to go to. What people do is go to all of them look at things or buy something. The only thing they should be doing is homework or buisness. Also people play to many video games on the computer too. My second reason is that people go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or use web cams. Those people could be on there for hours talking to people. Sometime those things are peoples life and all they do. I know someone who has a @CAPS1 and after school all they do is talk to people. They have friends on @CAPS1 but no friends in real life. My third reason is when people do go on all they do is eat junk food and get no exercise. Sometimes they eat potato chips and cookies and have soda. If you do that for week you will be very tired and sleepy. Also you can get very fat. Your body will be unhealthy and out of shape. Now that you have read my reasons, I hope you like them. My reasons where people don't do anything but surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and people eat junk food and get no exercise.",3,2,3,3,3
215,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am expressing my concern to you about the side effect new technologies, such as computers have an humans. Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise. People also do not get to spend as much as their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family. Firstly, people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their time surfing the net. Study show that an average @CAPS1 spends in total @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending on it. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 technology society, says' that if this increases @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on the internet, continues for more years, most @CAPS3 will completly lose contact with family and friends outside @ORGANIZATION1 the social computer network. The average weight @ORGANIZATION1 a @NUM2 year old has increased from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1, to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics show that the main caus for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the acessive amount @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on computers in addition @CAPS4 do not have as much time to exercise. Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each. @CAPS5 the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym. All @ORGANIZATION1 these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising. Secondly, comuters are effecting the people get to go outside and enjoy nature. Form my personal experience nature is a beautiful thing to be apart @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 now adays I spend way too much time on social networks such as facebook, my space and @CAPS6 others. How often do you go outside to take a walk, fo for a bike ride or something else? A study done by @PERSON2 shows that the average person living in @LOCATION1 have only spent a total @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM5 days outside in the past two years after reciving their new computer. This must change people need to enjoy what this world has to offer. Thirdly, computers have effected the interaction between family and friends. ""@CAPS6 people hav only been interacting with family at mandatory times such as school meetings."" says @ORGANIZATION1. Family and friends are a major importance in everyones lives. I love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup @ORGANIZATION1 hot chocolate. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people now a days do not spend anytime with family and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people use computers to interact with friends. It is vitally important that people stop using computers because ""before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends"" says @PERSON1 from I.U.M Computers help people lose communication and interaction with fmily and friends. In conclusion, I urge you to make the right desion by quitting using computers and in return will be a much happier and stronger individual. Computers impact humans in a terrible way because people spend too much time on them leading to a lack in exercise, time spent outside and in addition interaction between friends and family. Sorry about the lack @ORGANIZATION1 organization towards the end, I ran out @ORGANIZATION1 space. Please excuse the mess. Thank you.",5,4,4,4,4
218,1,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 want your kids & citizens to get fat and lazy? Or be active, learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you? @PERCENT1 of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well I think after reading this those extra @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn @CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could got their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club. This can work to people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. Their are great things to @CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big faster in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up tell them to use dictionary, theasaurus or a book. If people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs. Bt @CAPS1 help find carrer options and life. sitting on front of a screen can your health and also. Their are better things to @CAPS1. Instead via internet. You can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends. If your a boy you could just go @CAPS1 like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since geting p and side could help you socialize and learn and even loose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity.",4,3,3,3,3
229,1,"Dear Readers, Everyone now-a-days has a computer. This could be a good thing but mostly its unnatral. People can now do things they couldn't do before; when people move they don't need to send letters to one another, and have to wait days for a reply. Now they just sign into aim, facebook, or myspace. Then they can talk in time. But thats only the good things here are the bad. People spend less time outside they don't look at any of the butey anymore. We don't spend time with our friends any more. I can't even remember the last time I had a face to face convetation with soemone if I didn't have to. People on the internet can do anything they want. You @MONTH1 be saying thats a good thing. Right? Well the answer is no! People can hack into almost everything. People can cyber bully others with out any one ever knowing who the other person is. People can also be any one they want online. Say if I was @NUM1 and I wanted to stalk so little @NUM2 years old I could also pretend that I was ten and pretend make friends with the ten year old. When I found out enough information I would then be able to find the ten year old. Before people wern't able to do this. If people start to see what is heppening with our exsistence the more people would stop being stached @NUM3 to their computers.

232,1,"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world.",5,5,5,5,5
242,1,"Dear Newspaper, In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. @CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town.

245,1,I believe computers are a benefit to society. Computers help hand eye cordination they make it easy to learn about different places and allow people to talk and video chat. Computers teach hand eye cordination when typing and eventually you get so good you dont ever have to look down at the keyboard. you can search for anything on the internet and if you want to learn about a country you can search it and find out all new things you never knew before. Maybe you want to go on vaction to another country and can't decide which country to go to you can go on the computer and look up tourist attractions in those countrys to decide which are you want to go to. If you are on vaction or live in a different place from you and want to see them you can video chat with them over the computer. Those are the reasons why I think that computers are a benifit to our society.,3,3,4,4,4

Some people don't like them, and then there's people like me who do like them. Computers can let you communicate faster, you can play all sorts of games for @CAPS3, and it provides information. Nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them. Unlike sending and writing letters to people, instant messaging is a much faster and easier way to talk to another person. Sending and receiving letters can take days or weeks, on the other hand, instant messaging takes only a few seconds! Even better, it's @CAPS3! Instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family, there is also video chat. Video chat is just like talking on the phone but you can also see the person you're talking to. You can be talking on video chat with someone from another country, and guess what? It's also @CAPS3! When you make long distant calls, it can be very costly, but video chat won't cost a penny out of your pockets! Not only is a computer good for communication, but you can also play fun and entertaining games! Everyone enjoys playing games, whether you're one or eighty-two. There are @CAPS2 websites on the internet and among them there are game sites. Most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for @CAPS3! There's one player, two player, and party . This means you could play alone, with a friend, or the whole family. Everyone on in and have a time. Also, computers could be for fun and your used for work. The @CAPS2 information. It's like your own personal library at home at a touch of a finger! Either you're doing research on a project, , or just want to be informed, the internet can help you with any subject. All you have to do is search the topic you need whether it's cooking a certain dish, learning about space, trying to spell a word, or anything you can think of, and it'll all be there for you, and once again, for @CAPS3!

260,1,"Over one million people on the computer daily. I think being on the computer is unhealthy. So many people abuse themselves staying on to long. You should manage a time schedule so you can still get excercise dont use the computer if needed. People become overweight also. I think people should do something els then use the computer. One main effect that see is many people play the computer too long and are becoming overweight. This can be stopped if we all join together. One person isn't going to change anything. But many of us will. We can be the huge dangerous preditors going for the prey. If there is something els to do besides play the computer do it. If you know your over weight from the computer. You!! Can make a change. If you keep doing other activities you can get skinny again easily. You just gotten make that type of change. A serious issue is people don't wanna take time to make a quick little chart to manage computer useage. The way isee it is if we make a chart then we will know when to get off and twhen to play. This is important because some people take in information better when they have it infront of them. This could make some satisfying results. People use the computer for school work. This is good depending on how long it takes. In my opinon people shouldn't be on the computer or more then @NUM1 hours to @NUM2 hours a day. I think people should get their schoolwork done and get off. I much rather see kids outside playing. The nature and wildlife is much more important. The effects on the computer puts on us can vary.

Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importances and plan things and a lot more. First, computers have become a vital part of education and research a like. Students at schools, elementary through college, are able to connect with much more information than without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur!

270,1,"Dear @CAPS1 sun, I find that computers are very useful. They help people in many ways. They let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach hand eye cordination, and let you meet people online. First, people can learn about what is going on around the world. I can find out what is happening where I live by looking up your newspaper. Other people can find out about places they might go. They can find out what the weather is like so they know how to puck when going places. Also, if one of your employees is going camping they can look up a good place to camp and they can look up what kind of dangers there is when you camp so they can avoid them, because if they get sick they can't work. As you can see computers are important. Next, computers teach hand eye ncordination. Many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands. Lets say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it. They must be able to work well with their hands to fix it. Now lets say the wiring in your lights get messed up. So you call an electrician has to be good with his hands to be able to work with small wires. Both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers. As you can see, computers are important in today's life. Lastly, computers let you meet new people online. Lets say you are all alone after a hard day of making newpapers. You could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games. Now lets say that one of your employess just broke up with his girlfriend and he is sad and lonely, so she isn't working as well. He could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl. Now when he comes to work he is happier and making more papers and if he makes more papers you make more money. As you can see computers are very important.

271,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of.

People need to go computers @CAPS7 games, @CAPS8 hows all on the computer at the You dont even have to take This is bad, People need do @CAPS11 the old fashoned way. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 @CAPS4 use the computer daily. People lose jobs over computers. Everything is made so simple, theres no need to hire secretary, as employ and more office personals. Factories, They dont need many people. Computerized @CAPS10 can take over jobs quicker, easier, and cheaper. They will one day take over. Thats not good.

303,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying "",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!"" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, amking many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see. Please understand the meaning how terrible computers are.",4,4,4,4,4
307,1,"Dear local newspaper, This world is filled with electronics. These days the computer is the latest hit. But even though it's popular, is it really the best item to have? Many children and even adults are hooked onto the computer. It is taking away their life. Four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play. That's not how you should spend your life. We all want our children to be active and healthy, not be a couch potato. Each day, more kids are getting addicted to the computer. Now, every time a parent needs to punish or ""ground"" their child, they take away the electronics. What ever happened to grounding them from going to hang out with their friends or just playing outside? Another horrifying conclusion that the computer does to us is rip apart us from our loved ones. Kids are more worried about ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" or even trying to slay a dragon than spending time with their family. They would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever. This computer is splittling families apart. Now, more families only spend time with each other when they eat dinner together. Also, rather than talking to their parents about a problem, kids are going to websites like ""@CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS4.com"". More people don't enjoy doing some things now because of the computer. Not many like going out and enjoying nature. Some don't like reading anymore because they rather play games. Some people don't even want to pick up the phone and call for a pizza. Also people who look for jobs don't go to the newspaper anymore; they go to the internet! The world is revolving around electronics. We need to end this before our kids or grandchildren start getting out of shape and start relying on the comuter for everything. Do we really wan't to destroy this world and lose bonding with our families? I say, make life better and get rid of computers!",4,4,3,4,4

Today in america over @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer, according to the @ORGANIZATION1 are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary. Communication is a vital part @ORGANIZATION1 america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. @CAPS3 computers provide better and faster communication.

311,1,"Dear Newspaper editor, I think that computers are @CAPS1 for everyone. First of all, you can learn about places that are around the world in a click. Also, you can communicate with friends and family. Finally, it makes your life so much easier. Here are some reasons why you should get a computer for your family. First, you can learn about things you didn't even know were real, in an instant. You can learn about ancient civilizations, different cultures, and different recipes for tonights dinner. you can get help in school work also. If you need to learn about the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @LOCATION1, all you have to do is type in it. If you need to learn your multiplication table, you type it in and it will show up in the matter of seconds. The internet is @CAPS1 for searching up all types of things. Secondly, you can talk to your family members and friends on the internet. Ive heard a lot of people saying people need to spend more time with their family. So on the computer you can talk to someone in @LOCATION2, and evrywhere else. Its like a pen pal but you don't waste money buying envelopes and stamps to send a letter. computers cost a lot of many but it is worth it. You can do almost evrything on the computer. Lastly, if you get a computer it makes your life so much easier. Instead of going to the library and getting a cook book, you can type in dinner recipies for chicken. Your computer will come up with hundreds of different ways to make a @CAPS1 chicken for dinner. You can tell a friend that you cant it to there party. Also, teaches you homework that you did. if you buy a computer your life would be more relaxing. In conclusion, you should buy a computer. If you do you will learn so many things. Its like having a book with everything you will every need or want to know. This is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time. ",4,3,3,3,3
326,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students @MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the @CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Student and employees use @ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Futhermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to @CAPS8 loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through @CAPS3. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families,but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due the @DATE1, but their printer is broken, they @MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 just to get information. Computers provide a pletvera of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners @CAPS5 also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the @LOCATION1, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books @MONTH1 provide a description, nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. on average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in @CAPS6 will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence.",5,4,5,5,5

We all use them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge. Computers are like people with fun to do and things to learn. Computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide. Computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday. It used to be old letters by mail, then it became e-mails, twitter, and facebook. These websites upgrage communication today. Long distance friends can view photos, information, videos, and chat from far away. Some site like @ORGANIZATION2 allow you to instant message your friends. Lastly, video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person. According to @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 more user signed up for web-cams since the beggining of @DATE1. Communication is positively affected by computers. I know you @MONTH1 have fun with sports or nature, but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly. Computer games only cost about @MONEY1 and are instant access. Also, surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes. Almost everyone who has a @CAPS2 gets a blast surfing the internet. Do you ever wonder how to hear the song you like when it's not on the radio? Itunes stores, organize, and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access. What also happens is youtube allows you to watch music videos or hear songs for free. Now thats why computers are straight entertainment.

Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence and drug use are all over the web. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet.

You can learn almost different people and their cultural background, or even talk to your friends and families that live in other cities, states, or maybe even countries. Yes, some people might say they cost too much, but that's really only a one ime price. Computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers. That reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites. On the other hand it helpful for teachers because they can put their students grades online and won't have kids bugging you about what's their average in a certain class. Yes, I know their are bad unappropriate websites, but their are a lot of ways to block them.

In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information.

378,1,"Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you @MONTH1 not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or laptop is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the @CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a @CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society.",4,4,4,4,4
384,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers have a possitive effect on people? I know I @CAPS2. Computers are good for many reasons: @NUM1 reason is because people can learn about far away places; @NUM2 they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @NUM3 they can teach hand eye coordination. First off if you're taking you want to learn about where you are going. Computers can help with that! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you. You can @CAPS2 many things while talking to freinds on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderfull things. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurece bill. If you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. So thats why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver.",4,4,4,4,4

Think about it, paper is made out of trees and of coarse to get the paper you must cut down the tree first, and then have it an through a whole wasteful process to get that paper.If everyone used computers we wouldn't have to cut down those beautifully, lush trees. And also, have you ever needed to get information fast? Well instead of going through a book and possibly searching for hours, finding that information on the internet would be so much faster! Lastly, in the future everything will eventually be run with computers, they are the then now and later! They'll never get old! Computers are extremly helpful with endless information. A lot of people @DATE1 are very sensitive about our enviroment and how we're treating the earth. They are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible. An easy alternitive for paper is a computer. Once for school i was assigned a paper; i looked up the information on the computer easily, typed it up, and sent it by email to my teacher. Not a single peice of paper had been used! Ok so i know, computers use up a lot of energy, but to be honest they don't have to. Many people around the world use solar panels to gain their energy from the sun to power their lights, computers, etc.! The use of computers is extremely eco friendly and like i said before is a great alternitive to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information fast? Well on the computer you can! All you do is type in what you need in a search engine and @CAPS1! you have the info you need! Instead of using a book (which wastes trees) to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job. A poll was token and shows that @PERCENT1 of students at @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school who use the computer to look up information get faster and more accurate results! Do you want that or slow information found in a boring book? The future is not far away. It is already @DATE2 and we are using the computer for so much. Ok so the computer does show to cause distractions and headaches if used too long, but it is a great invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering off we'll order of computers/touch screans. More and more people are coming up with beter and faster computers. Everyone is using computers and love it and they will difenetly be used in the future. I hope you see how amazing computers can be. They're enviomentaly useful and a great alternitive to paper, they help you find the information you need fast, and proffesor grant states"" i do all my work on the computer, without it i would be lost.""

Using the computer effects a person's time because the sit for hours playing online games, @CAPS1 also effects there heath because there not getting any fresh air or spending time with there family, lastly @CAPS1 effects there education because time they could be using doing there homework there on there computer. First useing the computer effects a person's time, @CAPS1 does that by wasteing hours sitting there when you could be outside playing or doing chores around your house. You could be helping your family or friends out but instead playing computer games. There goes all the time you could have been doing something good, wasted because of the computer. The computer also effects you heath because your in a room inside not getting any air. You're also not exerciceing and helping your body out. This could effect your emotional heath. When your on the computer your not talking to people and becoming social and you could loose connections with you friend and your family. When you loose your connections and become you will use your computer more and then @CAPS1 will become worse. My last reason is that @CAPS1 effects education because when you could be doing your homework and studing for an important lest on your on the computer learning nothing, then you will school and possably mess for ever! This is really bad because you were on the computer. A couple times I pushed homework aside to use the computer and my grades drops alot. So this is why @CAPS1 effects education.

411,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with “real” people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these cootraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. Finally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with “real” people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply don’t learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate people @MONTH1 never get to know each other and the world @MONTH1 become an electronically based workspace. Finally @PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they can’t feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a person’s words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4’s @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the world’s currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live.",6,6,5,5,5
412,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I beleive that using computers is a good thing. They can help you learn about subjects of places you think are interesting you don't know about. They can help save the environment. These are the reasons why I think using computers is a good thing. First, they can help you learn about new subjects. Say you are doing a report for school on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2, but you didn't know any thing about them. You could just go sit at your computer, enter ""@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2"" in a google search, and press enter. There you here hundreds even thousands of entries about the @ORGANIZATION1. You could sit forever and learn all about these magnificent creations. You can learn about any subject on a computer, at anytime. You could even learn about a computer and all of its history! Seond, they can help save the environment. People are always using paper and paper comes from trees. When we cut down trees we are harming our environment. We are depleeting our oxygen supply and destroying habitats of animals and insects. If everybody used computers, we would be using less paper. We could use to send documents and papers, we could bring to tax appointments and pair suits. Computers could even be used for school work. The teacher could asign the homework email it to the student the student could fill it out and email it back. Sure we would still have to use paper for somethings, but we would be using in way less. People could also use less fossil. We could talk via the internet and things like skype to communicate witness waring to and burn. Thirdly, computers could help us advance into the. Computers can help find ways to do many things such as better medical treatments, more efficient travel and even every day life. We could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers. We could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold. Computers could also hep us find more efficient way. They could help find a mroe efficient feel, efficient of it could help make a teleportation device. It could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies. Computers could also help us with our every day life. When you get up in the @TIME1, imagein being able to screen and being able to have a hot shower, your breakfast and your work equipment all ready within five minutes. That really would be the future of computers. Those are all of any reasons for having computers from school reasearch to space and beyond.",5,5,5,5,5
416,1,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think we should have no more computers rather then looking on the computer. I strongly think this because this could cause serious damage to the eyes. My opinion for having computers is I don't think we should have them because you don't get enough exercise. You would just sit there looking at the computer all day. You would probley get all fat through the course of the year. You would be like a couch potato. My next opinion is we won't be able to get out of the house to see the beautiful nature. Like all the trees, flowers, wild life animals too. If you don't go outside there will be no fresh air for you. My last opinion is if we have computer. We won't be able to hang out with friends and family. You wont be able to see how big your family is. Or how small they are still small. Well these are my opinion's for having computers.",3,3,3,3,3
418,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 name us @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout the @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This would help you because at @CAPS1 age people are dependent on computers! they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most @ORGANIZATION1 the time people are satisfied, and do benefit from the use @ORGANIZATION1 computers. First off, people are affected by computers in a positive way because they can be entertained whether it is playing online games, or participating in a fantasy sports league. Although I just mentioned two non-educational examples, there are many educatiional websites on the internet which children can learn from. In @CAPS1 personal life I can name so many examples @ORGANIZATION1 entetainment. I use such as @CAPS2, which is an online game website, or fantasy football teams I am involved in. Another example @ORGANIZATION1 entertainment is when @CAPS1 younger brother. Parker goes on leaving websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is sloveling infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen he is learning. Also, expert say that children in the throughout the world learn more from the computer then from a textbook, or hearing information from a teacher. They say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. @CAPS1 next reason why effect @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people is positive, is because it helps people communicated with friends or family. @CAPS1 brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1 and since we do not see him often. our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. Because @ORGANIZATION1 this program we are able to stay in touch. An online poll was put out on @DATE1 which asked how people regularly talk to friends, or family. Sixty-three percent @ORGANIZATION1 the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most @ORGANIZATION1 the time. Thirty-two percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. this shows how much people communicate over the computer using, facebook, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and much more. I would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way. Lastly, computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world. On the computer at @CAPS1 house, everytime I open the internet there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6 devistation on @LOCATION5, and much more. Alsom a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie-chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fifty-six percent said they foud out their news from computers. Not only is it @ORGANIZATION3 students but most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all @ORGANIZATION1 his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and @MONTH1 recieve news about what's happening around the world. Like I said on the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most @ORGANIZATION1 them are!",6,5,5,5,5
422,1,"Dear, Who ever this concerns Some people are to obssesed with computers. They usually stay up all night playing games or going on @CAPS1. The people who love computers rarely iteract with people they like to be left alone with no one bothering them. Some people that go online to research stuff are probable being lied to maybe someones just messing with them. If you love computers so much that you stay up all night and don't get any sleep then you miss work and you get tired then you know you have a problem so quit. You dont want to stay up al night. Because you could have something important to do and you miss it like your childs party becuse you husband or wife typed to wake you up.

423,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people in our community use computers for positive ideas. Such as if gives you hadn and eye coordination, gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family. This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people. To begin with computers give a positive efect on people because it gives you hand and eye cordination. For example that can help you to have ability to do more. Like work somewhere such as a restraunt. This needs lots of cordination for holding heavy trays. My mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of cordination she tells me. Another reason would be you would have more hand cordination driving because you can react fast. Some people say that computers make you not be able to see while. Which than you would need glasses. But thats there desision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today. Secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places. Why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there. Another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries. Computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad, which also they arn't getting exersize if all there doing is researching when they can do that in the own town. But about @PERCENT1 of kids can stil be on the computer than go and get exersize. This is another reason computers are an impact. Lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker. For exmaple if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a @NUM1 minute send. Its quicker and easier. Another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well. About @PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to there friends But some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad. But to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its there friend. This is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults, and children, parents. To conclude, I would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and beable to talk to friends. Others disagree because it can ruin your eyes, not get exersize and lastly give your child unsafe. But that can be changed easily by limiting kids, see who they talk to and get them in a sport. This is why I think computers are a postive impact.",4,4,3,4,4

Lastly, the use of computer puts a strains on social skills between friends and family. Surely the effects of computers cant be good. First off, people in this aren't exercising as much as they should. Obesity and diabetes effects <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of @CAPS4. Both of these diseases are lethal. If you spend so many hours on the computer these diseases wouldn't spread nearby as fast. When will you get off the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym and exercuse so these won't affect you? Secondly, nature is a marvelous thing. Sure camping in a tent and catching dinner isn't for everyone. But, there are many ways to experience nature without ""roughing it."" You can go to the or to the aquarium. Sit on your back pond and go bird watching. All of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. Lastly, people aren't spending enough time with family and friends. Yes you can email, I. M., @CAPS5, and @CAPS6 family and friends, but its not the as people are less and friendly then they. Mainly of socia skills. We need to the of social without computer. In conclusion, computer do have a negative affect on people in the long tern. People aren't exersising. They aren't enjoying nature.

If a family member coms and visits you they would probuly email you about it but if there is no computers they can't tell when there coming. Are they gong do show unispectly they might not even be home and if they show up without them knowing there out of luck. And we exersize on our overtime we pick what time and we do it and if we play a sport were enjoying nature some people might have job's that take place outside of if. There are nerd's that are on computers all day long but in sure they enjoy nature I dont know about exersizing but they have a car and every thing they drive and things. Also, about the exersizing every on has to exersize to stay in shape im pretty sure people dont want to be fat there whole life they want to look good and feel good about there self.

There not gonna be able to see them in person if they live so far away inless they plan to meet each other but even if they do that there gonna want to email then not call were it costs money and texting only comes with sertain plan's of phones so all there is left is emailing.

For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good.",4,4,5,5,5

I support the advances on technology because computer can help hand eye coordination, it is easy to learn about faraway places or people, and the computer enables you to talk online. This is why it support the computer. First, the computer benifits society because it developes hand eye cordination. Did you know that nine out of ten people who use a computer have improved hand eye coordination. Bill @CAPS2, creator of @ORGANIZATION1, ""The keyboard is the most important part of the computer because it builds hand eye cordination.""

Next I support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people. Did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer when the to learn a place or a person. @PERSON3 stated, ""The way students study is much different than it used to be, @CAPS3 students use computers."" This reminds me of when recently I had a report to do on @PERSON1 and all needed was my computer. I see how you @MONTH1 think that enjoying natures is imprtant, intelegence is even more important .

But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people.

My mother works on the computer everyday at her job, though it @MONTH1 not seem important to you, it is to my family, who needs the money for food and bills.

It can help people drives it decreases reaction time and it can help people write more neatly. If it can help a driver turn his wheel faster or hit his break I think that hand eye coordination could help that driver stay out of an accident. Think of a climber trying to grab a on a mountain.

467,1,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have many posative affects on society these days. I believe this because computers provide us with communication skills. They provide you with information and they increase your skill when it comes to technology. Read on to hear how i further explain my reasoning. First off, computers provide you with communication skills. I know that i am always finding the computer useful. It allows you access to websites that help you talk to new and dd friends. It is a fast and easy way to communicate with someone. Whether your at your house, or on the go with your laptop, you can talk to people all over the world. Secondly, computers supply you with information to write papers, newspaper articles, etc. When a teacher asks the class to with a paper about a specific topic, students can simply just go home on or type the topic in on a search . At that point they're automaticly supplied with thousands and thousands of different sources of information. I know that @PERCENT1 of the population of the @LOCATION1, prefer computer sources over book sources because computers are so much easier when it comes to finding specific information. Lastly, computers increase your skills when it comes to technology. Although some computers @MONTH1 be fairly easy to use companies are constantly trying to increase the difficulty of computers. They ar also always coming out with new software for your computer. By making computers and softwares more high tech, people the generation now is more technicly advanced than many other countries. As a whole computers have a huge impart on our countries technical skills. I believe computers have a posative affect on society. I think this because computers provide us with communication skills, they provide you with information, and they increase your skill whenit comes to technology. I hope i have made it so that we are looking at this from the same angle.",4,4,4,4,4

These machines help our world become an easier place to do. work, pay bills and even entertain ourselfs. @CAPS3, these things are weighed down by the negative effects like the online dangers, increasing  to reality, and the obesity problems we face. With our new advances people are spending more time sitting around than being outside, which udds more and more to obesity problem we face. Kids and teens today would much rather be on their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 account, than go for a run or shoot some hopps. Also, more and more ads are on the web for unhealthy foods making these kids more likely to eat more junkfood. Finally, the internet fools people into believing they can go on easy diet eat. and become skinny with no worries. Along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats. Viruses can hack you computer, steal you personal info and destroy you computer. You can have huge bills for things you didn't even buy! Cyber bullies are also a new and dangerous threat!. These people threaten and taught inosent people. I remember a story of a girl who took her own life because she was bullied by someone who turned out to be another girl and her mother. Finally, online predators are a great threat to teens. These people brain wash people, convince them to meet, and rape and kill them. Last but not least todays computers interaction with young minds increases ignorance with ads, and negleck of education and reading. Many kids even myself would rather be online than read a book or do homework. @CAPS3, computer can take over some people's likes, they will neglect school and other important things like homework or studing credting weaker minds for out future. Also, ads and website with false information can fall down our youth even more with ignorance and ignorant belifs. Finally, kids computer interaction can cause belites like ""you shout vote for @PERSON1 because he is black"" or other racist and ignorant statements. Computers help our advance in bettering the world and our understanding of our world, @CAPS3, certain aspects can create ignorance and danger for people yound and old, and their minds.",4,3,4,4,4
473,1,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 i think it it good and bad. The good is it teaches people about @CAPS1 places and how other people live in there soicty what they do to get food or how they raise there kids. It also help people like cops. Because the have a person there looking for they have the computer to look on. It also help cops as in a speeder they can see it her or she have done it befor. It helps teaches to get a lesson or line to teach or they will put you on line to help you with your typeing. Yes it dose have a positive effect on some people. So people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do there best work online. Like say a high school paper. Yes you can talk to other people online get @CAPS1 friends. On the other hand computers can be bad as in you meet people online you don't know who that person is or where they come from. They might have a long crimal. They might be some on want to get you in troble because of his or her family problems. Some people spend to much time on the computer because they meet some one they rally like and don't worry about what the family want to do. So people use to work out every day but now they can talk to they friend all night and all day they stop and forget about it and never start agine. Some people just stay in the and stay on the computer got playing baceball or football or going to family reunions.,3,2,3,3,3
474,1,Do you like going on the computer? Well after you read this I don't thing you would want to. I know that the population of @ORGANIZATION1 uses the computer. If your on the computer for @NUM1 hr. yo can damiges your eye and you would have to were glass and you don't want that soemtimes it's hart to stay off of them. The internet can be for alot for things like to talk to your friends and family. And to play games. the computer is for to about diferent things one thing you can learn is the presidents other thing is your family history. Now you know what the computer can do to you. Only use computer or @NUM2 or @NUM3 mins. That is what I would do.,2,2,2,2,2
480,1,"Do you really think computers have a positive affect? Don't you think way to many people are on their computer to long? You want me to write an to my local newspaper about what I think on the effects they give people. I think they have a horrible effect on people. @CAPS2 people are on the computer doing something it can give them headachs, eye sales but if they were outside they would be exerssing. One of the reasons f think computers have a bad effect on people is addictions. Their are many things people @MONTH1 get addicted to life facebook, myspace, formspring. another example, @CAPS2 my sister gets home first thing. She does is go on facebook, forming and youtube. My second reason who f think computers have terrible effect is because eye damage. @CAPS2 your staring at a computer screen for so long you don't notice but your eyes are getting damage. @CAPS2 f was in sixth grade I needed glasses because I was addicted to computer for so long and my eyes got damaged. My first reason @CAPS1 I think computers have terrible effect on people is because its a waste of time. @CAPS2 your at home on the computer and it's sum out you should be outside with friends, family, or even just a talking a walk, and it's also a waste of time because @CAPS2 your on computer you could also be instead. You might think they have positive effect yes, but they damage your body. these are the reason @CAPS1 I think computers have a bad effect on people. Instead of being on the computer join a sports club. Now is the time to take action but making more clubs or activities to people. the issue is people was to much time on computer. these are my reasons @CAPS1 computers have terrible effect on people.",4,4,4,3,3
482,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, @CAPS2 has been brought up to concern that computers are a mence to society. On the Computers are very helpfull. If one needed directions to a place or if one wanted to know how to do something @CAPS2 would show how to. They also can help you do things like read faster and hand eye corridnation. Computers are also a good form of entertianment. Those are some of the reasons computers are helpfull. First, computers can help find out how to do things. If there is evey somewhere far to go or there are many winding roads to get there you can use the computer. On the computer there are many maps that give detialed discriptions on how to get places. Specialist say that over @PERCENT1 veiwers get to their destianation. The due to lack of driving skills. Computers also help with instructions on how to make things. If there is a cake to be made the computer will have recipies to make @CAPS2. That also can help make projects. For example They show things about @CAPS3 mythology for making a @CAPS3 pat. The computer can help you, learn langues. There is software that can teach people languages just like books execpt that they have animated teachers to help speak the languege that one got directions to go to. Reading all the didn't langues can help you with normal reading. Another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 americans have trouble reading. That wouldn't happen if they had computers. Almost everything on the computer has to be read so @CAPS2 gives a lot of practices. @CAPS2 also will improve hand eye corodination. When someone something they watch the screen not their hand. Also on microcoft word to type an essay you watch the screen not your fingers typing. There are many games on the computer for improving hand eye corrdination. The last reason that computers affect people is that they are enteritaining. One the internet there are many fun games for all ages. Some games they could watch videos one youtube there are many funny videos there. As you can see computers are helpfull in many ways. They will give directionn to places or help people with reading, Computers are entertianing and fun.",4,4,3,3,3
484,1,"Although most people would say the invention of a computer is a good thing, I dissagree. There are many bad things about the invention of computers, they give access to the internet. The internet has innappriate pictures and writing, unclear identification, and games. The worst of all is that on the internet, there is always unclear indentification. Although something on a social website such as @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 might say a person is fourteen years old, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 might be someone that had just been released from prison and is actually fourty years old. There is never a way to know if its safe to talk to other people on the internet. Games on the internet are also very bad. Games are one of the causes or obesity in america. Also, games on the internet cause kids to be drawn away from their families. Another reason of why games are bad is because you can become addicted to them, and stare at a computer screeen so long you get eye-strain. There are also innapropriate pictures and writing on the internet. There is bomb making websites and illegal music downloading websites. Overell, computers are for researching but aren't reliable in safety and cause obesity nad family aruements.",3,3,4,4,4
492,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I heard what you were saying about if computers are a good or bad thing. I personally think that compueters are a bad thing. Three reason for this are, kids don't get any exercise people are doing innapropirate things on them, and they could lead to giving out too much info, which could lead to injury or death. The first reason is that for the amount of time that someone uses a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather well, if it is a nice day of course! I mean you have to agree with me on this one, the main reasons why people are becoming obese because of some kind of technology computers. The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing innapropriate thing on them. If people are doing such innapropriate things on them why don't the makers of the computers block them? I don't know, I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even? From what I have learned in computer class, they can be used for more innapropriate things than I ever even knew of! The @CAPS1 and final reason why computer technology could be a bad thing is because some people have given too much info away on them and have gotten injured by internet world @MONTH1 look like fun and games untill someone gets hurts, well thats what my mom says! In conclusion, as you can probally see I am really not a fan of the computer. The reasons why I don't like it are kids don't get enough exercise, kids are doing innapropriate things in it, and it has been used for injury and sometimes death. These are the reasons why the computers is a bad thing, so remember these tips, take this article into consideration.",3,4,3,3,3
500,1,"Dear local news paper, I agree that technology has a positive effect on people. Just like other electronic devices, computers can help you with hand eye coordination. Plus, some people like teachers, want to get staff off the internate for their students to learn about people and places. Others just want to talk to other family or friend member in other towns, states, countries, or continents. Once you read this letter, then you will understand my reasoning. Firstly, these technology enhanced dictionaries help you with hand-eye coordination. Before the computer, people had lose success in writing quickly. They had to make short notes or short handed notation like w/ or. Nowadays people write quicker and can write full words and sentences. They never understood what they wrote they put it in full sentences. When you play computer games, it gives you even more hand-eye coordination, That was only the first three reasons. Secondly, teachers use computers to get alot of school work and get information about history and geography. like an online school book, it can get information on just about anything. It can look up when @PERSON1 was born. When the dinosaurs went extinct. Fun what the government is doing now. A computer can store what you learn too. It also has search engines that help you locate the information like @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT1 of people on earth use search engine to find something on the computer. On search engines they have websites, pictures, movies, maps and more. That is why people use computer for research. Have you ever fell like you don't want to travel across the @LOCATION2 just to see your relative. Well I have a solution to your problem. Computers have all sorts of stuff to can fanicate to other people. The computer mostly uses e-mail. E-mail is like a letter, but put electronically. It also has @CAPS1. It is also like a letter. If you buy a special camera that connects to your computer you can talk to them personaly. You don't even have to travel to see your relatives in @LOCATION1. That is the last reason why computers have positive effects on people. Most people use computers effectively. They get hand eye coordination. Also, the learn important facts about places and people. Plus they can talk to other people. See what I mean, computers are some and also a positive part of society.",5,5,4,4,5
507,1,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think that manypeople are not benefiting fromusing computers. There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer. By using the computer, people are getting less exercise, not enjoying the nature, and not interacting with family or friends. By using the computer, people are not getting many benefits. As i mentioned, people who use computers too much are getting less exercise. By not exercising, this could really affect people's health. From recent studies by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people whouse computers too much are overweight. That is an extremly high statistic! By computers affecting this many people's lives is ridiculous. This many people really shouldn't be over weight. If these people aren't getting exercise they could become addicted to the computer. If peopole are getting addicted to the computer they @MONTH1 start to do bad things with the computer. They could publish bad things go on ridiculous websites, and watch horrible things. The worst is probably watching bad things. It really puts a bad influence on everyone. Lastly, if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes. If you are staring at the computer all day, your eyes @MONTH1 not be used to seeing everything else. It's hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next. Clearly, being on the computer is bad for health. Not enjoying nature is also something that people aren't benefiting from. As you @MONTH1 know, getting freshair is good for everyone. Its always nice to smell the nice @DATE1 air after being in school all day. Many people dont do this because as soon as they get home its to the computer. These people are losi a lot of refreshment. I recently interviewed @PERSON1 she told me that, ""many people don't get to see what's on in the world because of computers."" They never take that to look at anything thats going on around them. By keeping updated. You never know what topic @MONTH1 pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature. Lastly, there are always animals that need help. Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home i have and by helping these animals you're saving life. Many people dont have this opportunity because they are on the computer. Obviously, there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature. My last reason is hat by being on the computer you're not interacting with family or friends. In some cases, the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent. If you're a parent you need to help your family with everyday chores. I know, they can be innoying to have to do but you're helping your family and thats all you can do. Also, if you are a parent that has children they always need help. Some kids are younger and don't know how to find information for a project. But, that's why a parent is there. But, if the parent is on the computer they aren't able to fulfill this requirement. I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger. Lastly, family parties and computers do not mix. From past experience, when family has come over my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say ""hello"" to anyone. I find this extremly rude. I just hope that family members don't get offened by this. Clearly, using the computers takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should have limited time on computers. By using computers people don't have enough exercise, aren't enjoying nature, and spend less time with family. Thank you for reading my opinion.",4,4,3,3,3

Computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers. @CAPS1 is very challenging at first, but when you look @CAPS1 up on search websites you'll find all your answers. Chatting is the number one thing kids, adults , and teenagers do. @CAPS1 is good and bad in a way, @CAPS1 is good because because your phone bill wont be that high up so you save minutes. @CAPS1 is bad because @CAPS1 can also ruin your eyes just remeber dont get to close to the screen. The computer is all about fun, you have millions of websites you can go on. To have fun for example @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com those are the three main ones I go on they are so fun. They have tons of games for kids and for adults too. I Have proven my point that computers are not bad for you because they can help you learn, they lower your phone bill, and its also very fun. Yes I know they might take exercise time away, or hurt your eyes but who cares just make up a time limit so you have time to exercise. Do not get to close to the screen because @CAPS1 can hurt your eyes.",3,3,3,3,3
527,1,"@DATE1 @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, I believe that computers in today's society have a possitve affect on people. I believe this because if people use it for education purposes to chat, email, or to reasearch it does make a difference in peoples lives. If you use the computer for educational purposes like games, you could really learn a lot. For example, I help my sister with her multiplication on a math game we have. Also, I learned to type with type to learn @CAPS3. on my desktop computer at home. Many other people use it for these reasons too. They also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation. Others might only use it for chat and e-mail. These things can still benefit our society though. Using the computer for chat, such as, facebook, myspace, and twitter can also benefit our society today. These websites benefit us because we can meet new people, catch up with old friends, or even talk with carrent friends. also on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3 we can e-mail people instead of instant messaging them. For example, if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write on email. If you just want to say hello you could use facebook, myspace, or twitter if you have an account. Computers do benefit our society today. All of the reasons in my letter support my position on wether or not computers benefit our society.",3,3,3,3,3
529,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I agree that the effects computers have on people can be very negative to people, but they should realize what they are doing to themselfs and what they can get themselves into. Starting with people are on the computers more then they are using the phone, this takes effects on people sitting around on their computers and not cleaning their homes and taking care of their homes; but instead they are on the laptops or desktops. Secondly parents and childrens spend most of they time on websites to talk with their friends for example webcam and aim, this takes affect people because they can go on the phone or meet them up some place. In conclusion, people, but mostly teenagers and a little bit of adults up to ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 like to go on different websites sum as myspace.com, facebook.com, formspring.com, and more this constart rumors and can end up in bad or goods situations this can be a horrified effection on these people that do this very often.

540,1,"@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the world say that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about forgien people and places and also learn about where your family came from. So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. Another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? Well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. For example, @LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family. I hope you understand this better.",5,5,4,4,4
541,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing now adays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that it is hurting our society. This isn't right because you need it for education, people aren't on all day, and a job. So how could those things be harmful to society. Your right they can't. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have an education with out a computer. If you rae working and you need to get another degree for your job. You can't go during the day so you can find a school that has online schooling, for at night. That way you don't miss work and you still get your schooling. Another reason why is that a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project. Or cite your sorces. What if you need to type an essay what do you do then. No computers no education and you will go and works at @CAPS1 or something. Where you don't need an education. But people aren't on all day so what does that do to society. Nothing at all. Kids and adults go outside and have fun. They go on the computer to check e-mails, play games, look at facebooks/myspaces. But they have enough responcibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit in side then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way. Not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for thier self and don't need others, to do it for them. So it really shouldn't effect you at all. What if at you job you need the internet. Most office people have a computer to talk to others by e-mail or to fix problems. People who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money. People that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record. The video games are a perfect example because the programers use a computer to porgram what you want to happening the game and thet takes hours to complete. So how are computers harmful to society because I still don't see it. Education, people aren't on all day and a job are really good reason that computers should becept.

573,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. Al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truely it is not. People who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. The number one problem of the @LOCATION1 is obesity. It seems that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definetly taking part in the problem. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. This process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @CAPS2 eyes everyday. Computers are making this happen. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. When I go onto the computer for only @NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water. It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are damaging peoples health & @CAPS2 should be something done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the @LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time. But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not any more. This new @ORGANIZATION2, video chat, @CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article.",4,4,4,4,4
595,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 be true that computers @MONTH1 make people exercise less, enjoy nature less, and spend time with family and friends less but computers do benefit the society in many ways. Computers help students with homework and projects and they help communicate with other people. Besides the telephone, computers do have some bad things about them, too. Students need computers to help them complete homework and class projects. They help students create good presentations and students can use the internet for research. Having computers will help raise a students grades and help them have a more successful life in the future. Parents and kids can communicate long-distance friends and/or relatives and they can talk to co-workers, bosses, teachers of their kids, and with their own children/parents, too. Having computers would create more communication with some people and help keep in touch with family members. Besides all of the good things, computers do have bad qualities, too. They can lead to children seeing inapropriate sites, and maybe even a virus that crashes your computer! Most of the programs to get rid of viruses block children and adults from seeing inapropriate sites (like gambling, pornography, etc). We need a computer that is pre-installed with the best up-to-date virus protection system, that helps protect children, teens, and adults from viruses, inapropriate sites, and cyber-bullies. Having these will make a computer almost perfect! The computers everyone needs should help students learn, keep raising communication between people and be pre-uploaded with programs to protect people from viruses, bad websites, and cyber-bullies.

Computer are very helpfull in helping people Which brings me to my next point, computers teach The computer has @CAPS3 different and The computer integration @PERSON1 is a stafisticated, not only be creative in your way but gives you @CAPS3 hand eye @CAPS3 people are for the creativity and they from using a computer. @DATE1 Computers have and @CAPS4 have shown, @PERCENT1 of people say the number are way to communicate without contact with @CAPS5 the the computer is not such @CAPS2, supplying with boosts creativity and hand eye coordination and is also a main way of comunication. So @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 editors, writers, and readers. Computers are helpful machines, more the mist are missing out on using a computer.",3,3,3,3,3
605,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that if you allow you self to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes a day at the most that will allow you plenty of time to go outside & excersize. Useing the @CAPS5 is fine in moderation, but if you are constantly on the @CAPS5 it can't be healthy @CAPS2 You (unless its your job) you should only be on the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes to an hour a day! So me people are on the @CAPS5 so much that they re eyes get worse & worse, Not only does it affect your physical health but it take hurts your physical @CAPS3 are some stories of blood shut eye, pink eye, or even @CAPS4 this is a very serious issue the people who are like this are called @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 to @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 over @PERCENT1 of people say they know or are someone who is a @CAPS5 addict, and scientists say in the next year that number will double or even triple.

609,1,"Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are a good effect in our lives. Some of the reasons why I say this is the good to use when researching has fun games and activities, and they keep you in touch with long distant reletives. First if you just been given a assignment for school or work you @MONTH1 have to type and research on what ever topic a computer is a great source of knowledge if researching something or even checking your bills, @CAPS1, Computers are fun they have lots of games and activities for you to play and do. Just think you sitting in the house on a rainy day bored out you mind and have no thing to do. Just go on your computer and play some game or just find some activities you whole family could do. Lastly, Computers are good to stay in contact with long distant family members these days all you have to do is get a web cam and hours it up to your computer and now its they our grandma, grandpa, cousin, and uncle, or who ever is right there you can talk to them like you were on the phone with no cost. In conclusion, as you can see after all I wrote computers, are good for researching, playing games or doing activities, and staying in touch with family I @CAPS2 in my house the computer is mostly used for the web cam to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. Well I hope this letter changed you oppinion on this great invention, the computer.",3,3,3,3,3
612,1,"In our socity computers have a big role. Some people think that this inhaces our socity and benefits the people in the @LOCATION1. Other people think computers are hurting the @CAPS1 citizens. I belive that computers can have our socity into the next and can inhance use to people. Comptores can benifit people by tracking hand-eye coordination give people the ability to learn about the world, and allow people to communicate to others. Computers can teach hand-eye coordination which helps people work with their hands. An arument on the of this is that computers take the place of exercise. For a lot of @CAPS2 a sport is their exercise and in every sport you need hand-eye coordination. Computers don't take the place of they inhance the persons ability to play for exsample to be a goaly in any sport you need fast mentions and good hand-eye coordination. A computer can help the save more goals by increasing their hand-eye coordination. Having good hand-eye coordination can also save you life. If a knife was you human nature world tell you to cover your head with your hands. This would you, if you had hand-eye coordination you away with your body to avoid the knife. Computers help you physically but they can help you mentally as well. Computers can take you around the world without leaving your room. Computers can teach go about culture and life that you didn't even know excisted. The cahan @CAPS1 can not aford the luexury of seeing the world first hand, computers let those people see the world from difient points of veiw. If a student needed to know all about one country they could go on the enternet and get a tour. A student could not go to the country so they went to the second base thing the computer. They can the wanted with one click. Family, friend and coligees are all people you need to talk to. Computers made communication easy for anyone. Now you can talk and see a person in video chat. This benifits socity because if you are talking to a buissness partner you can point to graphs and charts you made. You can also to see a love one that you miss. Their is a different type of comunication for every person. You can e-mail, @CAPS4, instant message, etc. Comunication connects people around the world it a small world after all. Computers have taken our socity in the next level. People can travel the world in a second, talk to anyone and have hand-eye coordination. Computers are growing @LOCATION2 keeping is on top. What would you choose?",4,4,4,4,4
613,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are using technology. A lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability, others disagree. I personally feel that computers are an advantage but also disadvantage. I say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning. I say it is a disadvantage because a lot of people are on the computer and they don't get a lot of exercise. There are pros and cons to computers but manly cons. How long do you stay on the computer? @CAPS2 people find computers more entertaing than going outside and getting some exercise. Since technology is advancing, more and more people are going out to buy computers. A lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer, playing games and going on their favorite websites. That is one reason why children from the ages @NUM1 and up are obese. They don't get enough exercise. That also leads into people spending time with your friends and family. I know alot of people like to spend time with their friends and family. But what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family. Your friends might ask you to go to the park with them, and you say no. Your friends are going to start pulling away from you. You might end up being lonely. Being on the computer constantly can ruins your life. If you are choosing the computer over other important thing, then I think we have a problem. Going on the computer all the time can became an addiction. I don't think people realize it, but it can. I can take over your life. I say this because when you have an addiction to anything, it is hard to stop. It is possible to stop all by yourself but thats rare. Majority of the times it is best to seek help, I personally think you should take all of these reasonings into consideration.",4,4,3,4,4
615,1,"Computers should be for everyone! Dont you think?, I do. And here's how @CAPS1 gonna convince you. Computers can basically be called a gateway to learning. Positive effects that computers have on peole is that, it teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow people to talk online with other people. These great qualities computers have for people are fantastic. Also the fact that computers just keep upgrading as time goes by. So, by you reading this introduction, I hope you are satisfied with what I am going to in order to show you that computers are positive devices and can be helpful to everyone. Firstly, as I started in my introduction paragraph, computers help teach people hand-eye coordinates. This i believe is a good thing to know because without it, there arent many things you could do. For example fly a plane. You wouldn't be able to do that without both hand and eye coordinates because you would have to manually move the plane, and check to see if everythings in order by multi-tasking. Furthermore, this is just one given reason on why computers are positive towards everyone's benefit. Secondly, computers give people the ability tolearn about faraway places and people. This is also good for people's benefits because, theres knowledge in every bit of it. Your learning about others cultures, heritage, family history, and so forth and so on. This could also help you in the long run with any job you want to do because knowledge can get you anywere. It can get you very far in life so learn as much as you can, and I beleive computers can do so. This is another reason why computers can be positive. As for the last reason, I say that peolple can also talk to other people online on the computer.This is also beneficial because again, like I stated in my @NUM1 paragraph, you can learn many things that way and meet new people. Now dont you think computers can benefit anyone! I do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers. For my conclusion, I would like to say that I hoped you enjoyed every bit of what I had to say, and you can also agree with the positive affects computers have on people. I truly beleive that computers are beneficial to all people and should continue to be around. it benefits society, and I enjoy every bit of using it. Thank you.",5,5,5,5,5

First, who wouldn't want to spend time with family and find out things that happend to them, @CAPS1 people because they are to busy being on the computer instead of going camping with the family, going to an amusement park and also some family gatherings. People who thinks that the computers is a helping thing to use but @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1 people learn much easier from family of friends then from a computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are becoming @CAPS2 because of computers intead of going for a walk or nice day they sit in their room and sit on the computer and seeing virtual things instead of seeing things. @CAPS1 prove who are sitting on the computer people you might should be joining a sports learns with everyday. Last, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 that go on the computer and adults are getting because of the of talking to people you have never seen or really know about. When you are on and someone and live where you live they can be lieing and you could take them seriously and meet up with them and that is how you can get killed or go missing. Also, the computer allows you to put pictures and videos online and a lot of teens and adults are posting up on the internet very inapropriate pictures of these bodies and people should't be seeing that. I hope that if you or a family is always on the computer you should say you need to spend time with your family, you can become very unfit, and you can be at risk of getting hurt by people you don't know.",4,4,3,4,4

We have even reached the moon and left our ! Computers have only become faster and. Although more and more people are using one of our greatest technological advances, computers, believe it doesnt benefit socialy. I veherrertly believe that computers benefit. They have the ability in and teach us what seems like information, second, they have made the could a smaller place through communication. Last, they even have the ability to locate missing people.

630,1,"Dear Newspaper, i am writing you this letter, about computers, in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1 the people in @LOCATION1 has a computer, but are they really healthy? I don't believe computers are a good thing. People spend to much time on them & less time excirsing, enjoying nature & most of all, it's highly dangerous. I don't believe computers are a good thing because people don't excersise like they did. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a daw on computers for others it's there whole life. People spend so much time on computers they lose touch with the outside world. Ever since computers came out, obestity has gone up. all people do is chat to other people & think ""they don't have to know what I look like.""They sit at the computer eating & eating. That's not healthy. I dont think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature. It used to be when I had somoe free time, I could call up a friend & ask them to take a walk with me somewhere & they'd say ""sure! Now they say ""@CAPS1 get on the computers & we can take a virtual walk."" That's not the same as an actual walk with the wind in your face the fresh smell, & all the animals, at least not to be. Nature is a thing of beauty & if you don't enjoy appreciate it, it'll turn into something hideous. Nature used to be the most peaceful think now it the internet. I dont think computers are good because most importantly they're dangerous. Little kids, like myself, think they're grown up & go on computers & meet rapist, murderer, thiefs, all kids of criminals. Also people send hurtful & violent things to each otehr & it yo're on the computer alot of bad people can track you down. Also, the military & @ORGANIZATION1 keeps secrets on computers but if your smart enough you can hack it. Computers aren't safe for anyone or anything. Well, I've told you my main @NUM4 reasons why I think computers aren't such great things, they're not healthy, emotionally or physically. People don't excirse they don't enjoy nature & computers are highly dangerous. All I can do is hope you publish my letter so everyone can see my point of view & make their own decisions. ",4,5,5,5,4
632,1,"People using computers is a good way for them to talk with distant relatives or friends, learn keyboarding skills, and research about far-away places. First, the wonder ful technology that computers have is amazing. They can surf the web in milli-seconds. This benefits people because if you were doing a research paper on china, many search engines let you surf the web at blazing fast speed, and in a little time, you could have all the information you needed. Scientists say that @PERCENT1 of computer-users have fast internet, and they reccommend it to other, first-time buyers.

I like playing games and editing videos, so I got an outstanding graphics car that has outstanding speeds for rendering videos. This let me play games and edit videos, and my @NUM1 gb hard drive is capable of storing all my programs and projects, for future use.

The last thing that computers help us people with chatting with friends on websites, like facebook, myspace, and @ORGANIZATION1. They all let you share with all of your friends, and of you needed to, you could chat with far away friends or relatives. This helps because if you haven't talked to your cousin in a while, you can check up with him and talk about things. I have a causing who graduated college and is now teaching in @LOCATION1, and when our gets together, we webchat with him on @ORGANIZATION1 and it is helpful because we haven't seen him in @NUM5 years, and we all wanted to see what he was up to. He was also able to send us pictures, which helped because we all missed his face. So, blazing fast speed to chatting with distant relatives.

Computer can help you earn in many ways one way you could learn from computers is students can go online and got information for their school projects by finding this information it can help the students get better grades. Also the students can use the computer as a way to study. There are educational games on the computer that kids play and without knowing this they are learning and studying for school. Another way you could too a is from online classes. This could help people also because do not have enough many to pay to go to classes. As you can see there are many ways to learn from having computer. The computer can also help you talk to people from out of the state or country. This could help famlies stay connected when they live so far away from you.

636,1,"Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people and companies and small buisnesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their buisness. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. I hightly reccomend that you get aquanted with such a useful and very recognized plece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small buisnesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is s former-district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This proves my point that companies and small buisnesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the buisness of which they run or one employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new. Some teachers (including my own, @PERSON1) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real-world. In my opinion, I it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Such buisnesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful, teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms.

Most of all @CAPS2 gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer.

A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Survey’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence.

Their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer. They are going to miss out of nature or hanging out with friends. Like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is theie family. I said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation and many more. It like if one of their family members hurt and they are trying to call you but you dont picking up the phone because you to busy on the computer to pick it up. You can lose your wife cause the computer because you forgot her birthday, her and her because you are on the stupid computer. About their kids, what happens if they want to playing they have nothing also to do card their? Say no cause you computer. They family will get rewing. My third and last reason is their job. They can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer. If they lose their jobs they can pay for they can't use their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer cause they have on it to much and did not pay attention was happening.

654,1,"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.",4,4,4,4,4
659,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them. Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper.

Having a computer can make you have lazy behavier, can @CAPS2 you from being indoors, and can @CAPS2 you inside so you dont hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. When your lazy or becoming lazy you dont want to do anything, and without doing anything you can become overweight. So, you need exersize because it's good for you and exersizing can protect you from health problems such @CAPS1 diebities. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses. Being so drawn to your computer can @CAPS2 you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for atleast an hour a day you'll see fore sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 you from what realy matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are realy important and if you don't spend time with them they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so dont spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun, I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, @CAPS2 you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least a hour a day they'll live a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer get off your couch, and enjoy your life.",4,4,4,4,4
668,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the conterversies between having computers. Computers are the center of technology. I can't imagine a world without them. Though having a computer @MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games, computers teach more and help children as well. I know for your company, having no computer would be a nightmare. It gives education to not only children, but adults as well. First of all, computers are proven to be the second best source of education, behind school, along with the best source of information. Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds. Not only are there websites. these are @CAPS1's with online tutors or just work. Computers provide practically anthing you need. For work, adult use. computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic. The technology of a computer is farther than any other item. Without a computer life would be much more difficult. Instend of just sending an email, mail would have to be sent out. Most information would have to from brooks. In fact even the internet has books to buy and read. I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends, but children need to be social, @CAPS2 it weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities. Lastly. computers have documents and it is the best way to type. Your company can definetly agree that without typing documents life would be a mess. Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other access to typing is a type writer. Types writers can't save anything, delete and do half the work computers do. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel @CAPS2 you couldn't use a computer. In conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. Without computers life would be difficult and stressful. Computers give education stand information to everyone. The technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life, easier. I couldn't even imagire no documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my decision. I hope you chose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time",4,4,4,4,4
673,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 my opinion on this is that people do use computer's a lot! Some people don’t care about exercising, or enjoying nature, maybe people dont even have friends so they spent a lot of there time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. For example @CAPS2.com, people/kids have one of those? They chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends. Enyways thats my opinion. Another opinion is that I think people should not spend most of there time on the computer. I think that because people should be having fun, socializing with people, and living there life! So this is what I I think, my opinion about ""Computers"".",2,2,2,2,2
677,1,"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I believe that computers have a terrible impact on society, the reason I believe this is true is that kids can go ""braindead"" as some people call it. Also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process. The last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it. The first reason I believe that computers have a bad impact on our society is that all kids do is sit there and eat while they are on the computer and they get an addiction to it so they just keep getting fatter because they arn't getting any exercise. This problem with children getting fat is already a very brought up topic and with something like this out it's not going to get any better any time soon. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kids who are on the computer more than a hour and a half a day are actually going braindead. This means that if this becomes the new trend for all kids that our next generation will not be smart and won't be able to keep up with other countries and fall behind, so we have to do something about this trend setting issue if you want our country to stay in one piece. The last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight. This can also bad for future generations. If you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect. These are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on the society. kids get obese, they go braindead, and they develop bad eye sight from it.",3,3,3,3,3
680,1,"Dear @CAPS1 man, @CAPS2 would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beachs. Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, @CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem? It really @CAPS4't. This is what I would say to having computers, People spend to much time on computers, excrise is needed, everyday, and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, @CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer, @CAPS5 whats that doing to your body? not helping it. I like computers to and I like spending time on them, when i need to get something done sometime that doesn't happen, because I get and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer, when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do, and there noding there head like they know what you sayed, but the next time you asked if it got done and it didn't, you know they were listening. Excrise is really important for your body and doens't even have to be to got anything, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to @NUM1 to @NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school, and jump right on the computers, families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body, it sucks the life cut of you. It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really dont want to do a lot, maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they @CAPS4't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who @CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused, from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. i hope you understand @CAPS2 I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities @CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also.",4,3,3,3,3
686,1,"Dear local newspaper, I would like to speak upon the topic of the effects that computers have on people. My opion on this topic is that computers do have an effect on people. Most people while surfing the internet don't keep track of time. What I mean when I say most people lose track of time is that, they try to keep track of the time but while on the web something @MONTH1 pop that catches their intrest and at that same time there focus is on something else. Some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them in the house. When many people are on the web they tend not to excersise as much. When in the house on the web most people that excersise stop excersising. The reason why this occurs is because while people are on the computer chair you feel so relaxed and calm that you don't want to get up. This leads into eating unhealthy foods. Some such as chips, donuts, twinkies and etc. Some @CAPS1 do not believe that is an opinion. The reason I say this is because while watching television the other day I saw a commercial that said quote ""@CAPS2 that are more active are healthier than @CAPS2 that stay on the computer all day. Most @CAPS1 do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active. Not being physically active can lead to A) obesity @CAPS4) cloged arteries or @CAPS5) lazyness. It can lead to all three because those are the effects of being on a computer every of the day. Most @CAPS1 should be enjoying nature instead of staying on the computer. There is a lot more to life than being on the web. Some such as playing sports. Not only is playing sports fun but at the same tim it is also healthy. Would you rather live to @NUM1 or live to @NUM2. And so local newspaper that is why I am writing you this letter today. I mean would you rather have friends @CAPS2 or be lonely. There are weight surgerys but those can rack up to thousands of dollars. And yes weight loss surgery does have effects such as death. So come on @LOCATION1 its your decison and remember the most important part of this letter which is between liveing healthy and young or dieing unhealthy and suffer. Its your choice @LOCATION1 decide.",4,4,4,4,4
702,1,"My opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you but people should not us the computer to lot because people should exercise, interacting with family and enjoy nature. Exercising is more important than a computers because it will make you health, you will not be sick so much. Interacting with family is more important than a computers because the @MONTH1 help you have friend but not a family's help you when you help and maybe that friend in the computer is maybe not real that is why it is important to interacting with family. And the last thing that is more important than a computers is enjoying nature. It is fun because you are not bored. You be outside, you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much. My opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer.",2,2,2,2,2
706,1,"Computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people learn about news in the world, places and people. Computers can also help people communicate with each other. Computers can also teach hand-eye cordination. People who support advances in technology, believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I whent on the computer and looked up @LOCATION2. It told me @LOCATION2 was located in @LOCATION1. Then it showed me a picture of @LOCATION2, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fasinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of whay they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper, on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world. Without computers people could not learn. On computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away. Scientist did a study on how people communicate. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 said they used a computer to comunicate with other people. People can use a webcam, aim, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or aim. Writing letters is to slow, on computer the other person your talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye cordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall. Computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports. Computer should be part of societys everyday life. Computer have a positive effect of people and they can help people learn new things, like, places, people, and news in the world. Computers are very benefital to society.",5,4,5,5,5
708,1,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are an amazing advantage to use in this modern day and age. They are easy to learn how to use, you can connect with old friends, and even learn by going to an online school or college they offer. Computers are amazing advancement and this is why you should use one. Who doesn't like computers? They are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms. Almost every college student has a computer or laptop. They could have never used one before, but then they learned how easy it was. Most computers come already installed with the necessary programs including: @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or some form of @CAPS2, a virus protection software, and other simple software. Moving is very hard, you leave a place where you have so many friends to a place that is so new to you. Computers make this so much easier by letting you connect with them without having to wait for the mail by writing letters. There is email, facebook, and myspace that let you chat with old friends, new friends, or even parents. Some people say that these things are dangerous, that is only if you start talking to people you don't know. People keep coming up with even more ways to stay connected so don't miss out on the opportunity. These people are so smart, they figured out a way to have school online. This is very helpful to somebody who is injured or is trying to get another degree to get a better job. People get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months. People get to do their job or enjoy nature still because their day is open and not busy. Sure people don't get to enjoy the campus, but with the price of gasoline these days, it's worth it. So don't be the person sitting around doing nothing, buy a computer and stay in touch with technology.

Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes gluded to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have childre. Adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutley nothing! We are so fortonate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. ANd even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running program held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly hapy but if we on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contatct. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusment park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our barkyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on computer for a long time.

723,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.",5,5,5,5,5
724,1,"@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people in the world use computers one time in their lives. Wether it's looking up information, sightseeing, or clothing with friends people are on the computer. They use their computers for work and games @CAPS1 children use the computer to learn. Some scientists suggest computers improve your hand-eye coordination, while others think it makes people smarter because they are seeing new things. You, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper staff, use a computer to type the news. You probally also use it for @CAPS3 of the things stated above. Most of the jobs in the world have one part that has to do with computers. Farmers @MONTH1 need to keep reports on their money income. Mechanics @MONTH1 use the computer to create blueprints, @CAPS2 officers use a computer to keep track of all the license plates. Baby sitters @MONTH1 need to do their homework.

Ever heard of @ORGANIZATION2? they macth people together. There is @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS3 more sites were you can chat with freinds. All of these reasons come together and say the computer does benefit society. They help people in any number of ways. I agree we should spend more time outside but we should also spend some time inside.",5,4,4,4,4
732,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits.",4,4,4,3,4
735,1,"As you can see, technology these days is always getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new invention that atracts many people to buy all the time. One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think to much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, @CAPS1 it's about same country, or how to solve a problem. @CAPS2, computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway. Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat. @CAPS1 it's population, density, languages, foods or holidays, computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help oprganize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people, is the feature of communicating with others, @CAPS1 it's taking to a faraway friend or family, or you're bestfriend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now, that they have webcams; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that @MONTH1 even live in another country, @CAPS2, most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straight foward directions. This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road. There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those for who are worried about the ones who should be exercising, being outside, enjoying nature, should learn to expand there time doing so, and shortening time online, and learn to be on the computer, only when necessary.",4,4,4,4,4
740,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that children are spending to much time on the computer for the wrong reasons. I say this because all young children and teenagers want to do is get on to @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all day instead of reaserching and things like that. I have three reason's why I think going on the computer for the wrong reasons instead of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friend is a @CAPS5 first reason is because it is very dangerous and there are sometimes kidnappers on the chat room. @CAPS5 second reason is because their taking time away from trying to learn stuff off the internet. @CAPS5 final reason is because the interact influences violence. There are @CAPS5 three reason, on to here more. @CAPS5 reason number one why I say people are spending to much time on the internet is because it is dangerous. Young teenagers and children all enter a chat room online. Most of the time that is bad because kidnappers lie about their information so that you can meet up with them and then they take you away. So instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking on the daily news or searching like that. This is why I say that the internet is not alway good to be on all the time if you aren't or learning about the nation. @CAPS5 second reason why I that speding too much time on the computer all the great sometimes is its taking away from your come in the and go to the computer instead of doing their homework on reading. @CAPS6 like computer sometimes more than they like is learned and thats not good because not knowing I could if they got up their is on the computer for educational games but they dont. reason why I am concerned that people using the computer a lot. @CAPS5 final reason why I am concerned about people using the computer to much is because the internet on the computer can influence @CAPS6 to be violent in @CAPS5 ways all games and going on yo all the that affects the world if they keep seeing violence and things in that nature frequently. I say this because in this generation when they see violence it gives an image in more need and then @MONTH1 think its cool to do it because it @CAPS6 like @CAPS3 more than a book on the computer more than a look. When young teens see violence on the computer @MONTH1 think it's cool. This is @CAPS5 final reason why I was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer. So these one some of the main reasons why I say that the computer is not always a good because people spend a much time on them.",4,4,4,4,4

People interact with others different countries, states, & or continents. Next, is how computer could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance today my class & I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers my class & I couldn't have get it done without the computers. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all & that would mean we would have to share. With sharing some kids @MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two. With computers we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computer can help set up activities. Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym signing up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance my little brother plays baseball & my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sihn up, register, & pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents didnt with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge & able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are benefitial to our new up & coming society!",4,4,4,4,4

763,1,"To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on, todays society. People depend on them a lot but same people disagree. I think that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very entertaining. They can help find long lost friend and keep in contact with them. Plus they can be helpful with homework. Please proceed on reading to see as why I chose these resons. Firstly, computers can entertain. The are thousands of games to chose from. Dress up to educational. Which are good for young children of age five through six. As it states in the writing prompt it teaches hand-eye coordination. In addition to my first reason, computers help long lost friends. There are websites that help you find people. For example @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and yahoo. These websites help keep in touch to, with family. If theres no phone then theres always the computer. Lastly, computers can be helpful with homework. Sometimes you don't even need internet theres a calculator built right in! But a nationwide website thats used and children improve from it is edhelper.com. This website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on. In conclusion, I think that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, keeps in contact, and helpful with homework. Please take my reasons into consideration.",3,3,4,4,4

After looking at these detail most people are likly to agree. Firstly it dosent take @NUM1 days to email you can email someone and it takes five seconds to get to the other person. While regular mail takes @NUM1 day to a week to get to another person. When you email some one and then the email you back it saves the and government money. Email is much fasters than the mall or I like to call it snail mail. Another reson is that you would be able to learn about diffrent contrys faraway and near. Would you be able to about @LOCATION1 from you living rooms without computers. No you wouldnt't. Without computers would you be able to learn about the earth quake in chile. No you wouldent. Compters are modern day telivision for kids. Lastly you can talk to people on the computer there is many ways to talk to people like facebook, myspace, aim, and vidio chat you don't have to call some one on the @CAPS1 when you can jus vidio chat with them. In conusion computers are good. You can email fast. You can learn about foreinge contrys in you living room. You can also chat with people online.

Computers are good for society, because people use computers to talk to friends and family on @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. This is a good reson becuase we all have family. So I think that this is a good way to talk to them. An for friends this is a good way because if they move you can talk to them on this. The reson it a bad thing is because people like older men can use the computer for child pornarapy and talk to younger girls about sex and thats not right. Now on to more about using computer for homework. The reson computers are good to us is because people can use there computers for homework. This is good because if you need to do something on our history then that what thats good for this is good because everything you need is on a computer.

Also computers help old time friends and family keep in touch. Finnaly I think they are helping are society because computers teach great hand-eye coordination. Studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of the people growing up with computers at home have a high paying job! Computers are very intelligent pieces of equipment and if you know how to use a computer you will most likley hae a high paying carreer. Also mostly every job from doctor to police officer to casheer at a store all involve computers and to go those jobs you must know how to work a computer. This is only one of the many reasons I think computers will benifit our soceity. Secondly, I think that this price of technology benifits soceity because it keep family, friends and workers in touch. Have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living. Far away, @CAPS1 computers are one of the most popular ways to do so with all the new websites like @CAPS2, twitter or even your old email website people are keeping in touch all over the world. Another way computers help old time friends keep touch with the new video camera in the computer, family, friends and workers can actually see each other from different parts of the world. A simple message though one of these websites will make someones day and could even make yours. Finnaly I think that computers benifit our soceity because they teach hand eye coordination other life skills. How do you think people can shoot a gun so and so quickly or how do you think a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time. All these things revolve around hand-eye coordination which is best learned by computers. Also people can save lives by just a type about a hurricane, tornado anything but if they do not know how to work a computer many people can get injured or die. These are only three of the many reasons I think computers benifit our soceity. So think twice about the negative comments people say about computers.",5,4,4,4,4

784,1,"Lies! The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. They benefit us greatly for the following reasons: computers are a source of knowledge, computers can aid the advertizment and buissness of many workplaces, and they are a very helpful and easy way to communicate with someone across the street or across the ocean. Without a dabt computers do nothing but benefit the people of our society. First of all, computers are a big source of knowledge. Many people @MONTH1 want answers to a question they have encounterned recently but cannot find the answers in a book or newspaper so they turn to a computer and immediatley their problem is solved. Computers today hold every bit of information on every topic imaginable from history to politics. All one has to do is find a site such as @ORGANIZATION1, type there question, and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem. Computers can also provide a place to research for a project or statistics of the economy if needed by school, buisness, or just for recreation. Times are changing fast and the sources of the worlds history and school subjects can easily be found in the corner of the internet. What you @MONTH1 have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. Second of all, computers and the internet support many buisnesses in advertising and making profit. Every single time a visit to the internet occurs many different buisnesses are able to advertise their products and overall buisnesses with pop-ups, side bars and websites. It clearly helps the workplace get attention. Along with advertising products buisnesses can even sell their products online without doing a thing. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of buisnesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, country, can be established by the use of social networking sites such as, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. You could send a letter with the touch of a button with out having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. An instant message, which can be used on any of the sites mentioned can also be achieved. This is where you could write something down in the computer, send it to anyone and receive a reply within seconds. Obviously, computers play a big role in the communication of one to another without a problem. In conclusion, it is clear computers benefit the society greatly without a side effect at all. Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to buisness, anda great way of communication. Everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today.",4,4,5,5,5

If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and a text. It's free too!

If a child does not have a computer at home this will. Make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to cant up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards.

We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment, in all these ways computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, & connections with people from just about anywhere, but some of us become too attached with this virtual life instead of living our own real lifes. This happens to many people, some don't even notice what computers are doing to them. For most people, life @MONTH1 be challenging & the real world to stressing, so they retire to the computer for awhile, & to me this is fine, but when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer, this would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think, they need excerise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game, & sure, in some ways, it is. But it could reach its full potential by doing something else thats not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a destruction. This @MONTH1 happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Now a days people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't neccessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets so what I'm saying is that a talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends & have real people come first. Like I said in the beginning computers are part of our everyday life, and its not a bad thing, they can be very helpful. But you must control what you do on them and how much you use them.

There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone.

Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree.

854,1,"My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. ""But"" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!",3,4,3,3,2

865,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have. My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese. You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my story. First of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. Also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more. Then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise. Secondly, you would spend less time with your family. You would think that your going to hang out with them later. So then you play more and get addicted. So then you and your family would grow apart. And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends. I think you won't have friends because if your on the computer all the time you wont even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone. The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. That you will never meet in real life and won't socialize to the about there life and to hang out with. In conclusion I think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spent less time with your family, and you won't have any friends to talk to. I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration.",3,3,3,3,3

If you have a close friend who moved across the country, then these ways to communicate would be very helpful to you! You cant have these accounts without a computer; therefore, we need computers! Computers have made our generation very intelligent. We can easily look up facts about anything on the computer. Now, if there's something we're curious about, we can just look it up on google. In the past, we wouldn't feel like looking in a book so we waid forget about it. Kids could get help with homework online if they are too shy to ask another person. At this point in time, we could even take online college courses! Being able to go to college at home can really come in handy in some people. Computers help us with our education. Adults who go to work everyday really need to use computers! people working in the medicine field, use computers to keep track of all their patients.

Computers allow the everyday family to see new places, through photos online, and people, through the internet. Computers also provide a social networking throught a community, state, or even a country! Lastly, a computer is another resort to go to when trying to accomplish something, because there is always something on the internet that will help you. There's a famous quote that goes, ""the largest room in the world, is the room for improvement."" In my opinion, the computers could make that room a little smaller. While experts say that computers are making people spend too much time indoors, and not too much time seeing the wonders of nature outside, the computer can prove them wrong. The internet is a wide ocean of pictures, wordes, and sounds. The computer is the item that organizes it, for your entertainment. There is a picture of just about anything imaginaeable on the internet; from the palm shaped islands of @LOCATION1, to the frozen @CAPS1 tundra in the @LOCATION3. You are able to see penguins in the southern ice cap and the ricefields of @LOCATION2 a bird's eye view all by simply moving your fingers. It's also possible not just to see places but to see people from how for the distance is! Today, people are sending pictures to and from each other via emails. People are actually sharing their memories with each other, all thanks for the computer. I hope what I have just explained now helps me make my. Computers are only here to make our lives. Imagine talking to your friends, not having an with his ever leaving your room. This would or even an impossibility fifty or seventy @DATE1, but this is People's social relationship have greatly progressed the half and it only goes has allowed people to their up on the their up on the their with their family and friends. I'll always a positive thing, using this right way. Having your house to tell, individually, your friend about your time to disney world is such a hastle. If you just put the pictures on a social networking system, like facebook, or twitter, memories will be stored through, litterally, the clicks of aborton. Memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer. Planing a vacation is a trough job to do, but what if that job could all take place in our sport? An entire vacation can be planned, confirmed and paid for thanks to the computer. Jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in @DATE1 minuets for less using the computer. This allows people more time to go have fun with their lives and not have to worry about plannings. Computers allow people to compress hours of work into a matter of minutes.

There should be a law that people has to go out and exercise before and after then use compiuters finally, I think that childrens should use the compiuter less than the adult fee health reasons. @CAPS1 first oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should make timers added to the compiuters to time tha amount of tim people should take depending on what they are doing like when some one is playing a game they spend hours playin instead of doing a diffrent activity. Also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad. @CAPS1 second oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have a law that people has to go out and exersise before and after they use compiuter because there is a big percentage amount of people who are obeast because everyone sits in the sits in the compiuters and starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours and they dont take a break to go outside and @CAPS1 third and final oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have childrens use the compiuter less than the adults for health reason's because kids are always looking at the compiuters an their eyes are always getting red and then they start to not being able to see as well as they used to then they end up having to need glasses or abetter perpscription glasses.

903,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that people should stay with computers. I have three reasons for this issue and they are @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. I think these reasons woul'd be a good for this issue because every human being can do these three this on a computer. One of the reasons why I think people should stay to computers is because they can learn. People can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals. They can go on the internet and look up what they need to find children can also learn on the computer by putting their jump stat first grade give in the drive. children can learn like this. My second reason why people should use stay to computers us @CAPS2. I think @CAPS2 because you can talk to your friends about. They can also talk about if they want to go some fun. For example same good exercise. Another reason why I think @CAPS2 is if your friend is explaining something to you, that your. I also think @CAPS2 can be had for other to a and. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computer is because people can discover different things on there these things can be had and some can be good. For example a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix this that would be good. And I will know about computers and man what to do. A bad thing about @CAPS3 the computer I can do is bringing up a virus. That know matter what I do I can't make it go away and the computer ends up being broken. Conclusion, Local newspaper this is why I believe that we should keep our computers.

907,1,"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most imfortant thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time,",4,4,4,5,4

The first reson I think that computers are great modern society, is that we can learn instantly about foren countrys. @NUM1 years ago the only way you could learn about places far away was if you read it in a newspaper, many which didn't tell you about faraway lands.

In the @ORGANIZATION1 computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations.

916,1,"Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1's the dillemant @CAPS2 that people are supporting computer technology and others are not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them everyday and it is very efficiant for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games, @CAPS3 effect that computers have is educational websites; games, and articals. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job. Primarily. computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as @ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide sarely for people all around the united states and other parts of the world. My father always told me, ""Computers save people everyday"". Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, @LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacherm. Mr, @CAPS4 his computer every single movning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purposed fealuired. Would you want all those people to lose ther job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't, @CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This is things like staying in town with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could ne relaxing to almost anyone. @CAPS6 is an example of keeping in town with someone else. For me, @CAPS6 is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website live @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my @CAPS6 deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give aduts and kids tree access to education. I remenber my old elementery school used to play many amusing math games. These were @CAPS5 my education grew greatly dae to this game. Games as these are used frecquently thoughout the world. In addition jobs have been lost from this had economy. However, jobs we hering found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers, computers are a good idea To conclude. I imploor you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student. for they are very important.

918,1,"To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives.",4,4,4,4,4

The @CAPS1 reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family, I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting.

938,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a child of the tech generation, or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning. That meaning is life. Our life revolves around technology in general as the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The chief technological preference, computers, is greatly beneficial, aren’t as bad as many people speculate, and help us live and prosper in this struggling world. Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a neucence but could never have used aho. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, lets be practical, how many normal people actually wake upwake up and point out the drearyness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously choes t o overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, bag things, and get the cutting-edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Further more, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? That’s funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companys and saves lives? You probably didn’t even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the hubble space carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didn’t choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didn’t even say that seismologist use computers to traet the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didn’t know. So, let’s face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did them. In fact, pardon me. You probably didn’t do the research in the first place, instead pointing fingers at the innocent. Smooth move, buddy.",6,4,6,5,5
956,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people that excersise and go on the computer mainly, I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise. Sure some people just chat and learn about that far away place they could go there and explore the buety and nature. I think computers are great effects on people, They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2 uncle that came from @LOCATION1 he learned how to speak english of the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are a lot. People have classes online they go to @CAPS3 mothers that are single that have kids for example, they get their diplomas and degrees of the computer online. And theirs other @CAPS3 @CAPS2 aunts and uncles they go to english classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. @CAPS3 i go on @PERSON1 all the time all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. @CAPS4's fun, but also educated. I think that all computer have positive effects on people. All of them should their should'nt be one computer with negative effects on people. But that's only by @CAPS2 opinion. Computers are @CAPS3 robots they do lots for us. We type reports, learn, read online. And then theres also were we play games online, and educated games. I believe that their are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example you could search up: mistery, animals, natures and places. You wouldn't beleive how many results the computer has. So who would have negative effects of the computer. All @CAPS4's trying to do is help us and out education @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2 spanish sometimes. So why would people think that computers arn't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tommorrow. Also I could see what the news are, and i could contact @CAPS2 teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people.",3,3,3,3,3
969,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I don't agree I think the experts are correct that people are spending too much time on their computer. My following reasons will explain why I don't agree. I think there is also an issue with computers. Please read on to understand my reasons. First of all, my reason on not agreeing with those who support technology is because their is no saftey! I think chatting online is great but dangerous. For example, most kids are followed by and its usually online. This is because the information all to unknown people. Also, kids get into dangerous for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to. Secondly, I don't agree because it also caused addiction to the computers. Most people get addicted for the certain things they do online. These life of can also become dangerous. For example, people play some video games wich people killing and commiting crime. We cant not do in the ""real' world. These kind of game also bring people to dangerous. Another example is we've had students bringing because violence is the answer when it ! The addiction to computer is so bad that people do have a look of and interacting with things. Lastly, I dont agree because its also. Most people who are and again. These of into an life because you do enjoying at all. For example, people die of. This letter will effect others so thanks for reading. Hopefully, people understand why I dont agree.",3,3,3,3,3
984,1,"Dear local newspaper, I agree that computers benefit us totaly. This lets people explore the world and do anything. Also, computers are used for many things. Last but not least @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So computers lets us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, college/school, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and its very usefull. You can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored. It keeps us in touch with the world. Also, many thing require a computer. For example, In order to play xbox live you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends. Some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 house hold have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail. Just @CAPS2-mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them. So I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said you can do anything. Like @CAPS3. It keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, @CAPS5 everyone has a computer. If scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them? I think computers are great! But whats you opinion?",3,3,3,3,3
985,1,"Dear @CAPS1, "" Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me, i can't live without a computer."" @CAPS2 my many local in the town of @LOCATION1. For me, computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications. But they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine. I also think tha computer is important because it is where businessmen do their job. My favorite part about the computer are applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps. are great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state, @CAPS3. Easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and so many other endless possibilities, You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very fun to do things on the computer that you enjoy, and not have to research all the time. The second thing on the computer, is research. Researching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, But researching is educational, and I asked a mother with a @NUM1 year old, a @NUM2 year-old, and a @NUM3 yearl-old and she said ""The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. Its's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The best thing about researching is that, there are endless amounts of websitees that have information for us to look at, and enjoy. People that work and have jobs, are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them ar researching while working. People that work, are th ones that are basically on the computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc.... The computers are mostly used by workers for e-mail. My father is always on the computer, checking e-mails, typing something for this boss; and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because foe some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, they'are one of the best things created. They are the best because they ahve amazing apps. for me to have fun on. But they also provide an educational opportunity through research. And they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person that can live without one of these technological beauties.",4,4,4,4,4
994,1,"Dear local newspaper, Have you even been on a computer too long & haven't spent time excersising, or haven't spent any time with your family? Well, that's a big problem here in the @LOCATION1. In my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain amount @ORGANIZATION1 time & after they enjoy themselves with a nice workout, time outside & most importantly with their families. I think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school & shooting right to wherever your computer is & being on it for the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the night. I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades. If your on computer all the time & don't have any time to excersise, go outside, and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. By not doing homework, your grades could go lower & you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. This one problem ran also affect you so many other ways. The problem with computers & why people, mostly kids are so attached with them is because @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as twitter, facebook, youtube, etc. & kids are @CAPS1 to them. This is part @ORGANIZATION1 the problem because kids can't get off @ORGANIZATION1 them, they like it so much. This problem leads to the main problem because if parents say ""Time to get off... go get some fresh air."" the kid always goes ""one minute"" & the parents let them get away with that, but then that ""one minute"" turns into an hour at most. This is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, its dark out and they can't go run around outside. I think this is important because think that facebook & twitter should be limited amount @ORGANIZATION1 time and should log you off after @NUM1 minutes. In conclusion, this problem is a national issue & in my opinion should be a new law, that kids have to play outside, and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. As you can see having all these great websites leads into a problem with kids. Thanks for your time on reading why I think computers are a big problem here in the @ORGANIZATION1.",4,4,3,3,4
1002,1,"Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instanly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great but the can also have negative effects on us too. I like, computers but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers it's like they're in another world. When your on the computer you are alot less socal than you would be if you not on the computer. On don't know about you but alot of people are addicted to their computers. They get on an they stay on forever. The act like it is a neccesity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like @CAPS1 and here is why. Compters get really annoyting sometimes. They distract people alot. Like the other day my sister and I were going to @NUM1 walking but we didn't go because she wouldn't help us exercise so we shouldn't be using it. In this economy it is important to have socal skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are going socal skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer to long I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eye sight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They @MONTH1 not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long. These were some reason why you should not use the computer. I am not saying that it is an evil contraption I'm just saying, use the computer for info and work not for games and other things. You could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out! Go make some real breathing friends in person.",4,3,4,4,4
1004,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers in there house hold but they disagrees with a computer can help you. There are some advantages in useing computers such as being able to search information able learn hand-eye coordination, becomeing organized, but it also has it's disadvangtages like children spending more time on the computer rather than going out side and playing with friends and exersizeing and staying fit. I agree with computers do produce a positive impact on children. Computers not only let a child stay in contact with their family that live faraway but it can also help them get a progect done more eveficantly and quickly. It @MONTH1 seem that where are doing one thing but when in fact we can be uploading pictures and movies, downloading muisc and playing games at the same. Now with all that I have told you @DATE1 I hope that we share the same point of veiws on computers like how they are good to have and their positive in part.",3,3,3,2,2
1009,1,"Has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computer in their school? Were you ever baffled when they said they were talkking about @CAPS2 in the school, that they can teach hand eye coordination, gives them the ability to learn from far away places, or even allow them to talk to people all around the world? What did you think about that? Did you agree? If you did then your thinking about the positive side and not the negative. Many reasons why I don’t agree. Saftey, the money, health. Many people said that its good to interact with other people but not all the time if your son or daughter interacts with people they @CAPS1 know are you going to be worried.? They can be asked who they are, were they live. Sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face. My friend @PERSON2 said her school got those computers and her friend @PERSON3 was asked to meet or with somebody she never knew and she ended up saying yes and @PERSON2 says she nevered showed up. Would you ever want that to happen to your child? Well this is only the begining. Once your child’s school gets computers they will be addicted to @CAPS2, @PERSON1 said that ""if a child does not go out and enjoy there childhood but they want concentrate on their homework, they will just eat and be on the computer eventually they will become obese.” @CAPS2 is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers @NUM1. Have you ever wondered that? Another thing is the school will have to pay alot of money, if your child ever damages the computers then you will also have to pay a lot of money too. Not only if your childs school gets computers @CAPS2 will benefit you guys alot. I trolly and sincerly do not belive that students should get computers. Also your students computers @MONTH1 get viruses because of inappropriate sites. Then your going to pay for that as well. Lastly the school will not have enough money for materials. What will you do?!? Your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education! Do you still support these computers!? I hope not because there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will or will not get @CAPS2. Hopefully I gave you enough information about the saftey, money and health.

1011,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common by now, but people argue rather they are really needed on our society. Computers give negative effects on people, for example, lose eye sight, interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise. One out of five people wear glasses or contacts, these days. the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes to lose eye sight. When people use too much computers, their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as well. These are sign of spending too much time, but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done, or simply addicted to the online video games. this shows that computers give terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there is no limitation to him or her. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted. Online, where anyone can go on, there are millions of people that are not connected or related. In other words, strangers, interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. They can have devastating influence, no supremacy, what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort. Unfortunatly, people can not trust anyone online because they don't know who it exactly is. For example facebook. People think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person. this is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. These people get not enough exercises, which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. For the reason, people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society because, they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight. Second, they are creating a unsafe environment. last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet. ",4,4,3,3,4
1013,1,"I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day.",3,3,2,2,2

While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers, and are waisting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can help with homework, interacting with people, and even help us with exercising. You'll find that in the end, computers end up as benefits for everyone. For many students, they need computers to help them understand their subjects. There are certain websights that give online lessons. Along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework. My math teacher, @PERSON2, is always saying,""@CAPS1 into the online sight."" I've found that it really helps me when I'm struggling with my work. We can also ask our friends with help if we still @CAPS4't understand. That's not all we can do. There are certain sights like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 where we can interact with other people. You can talk to them when they're out of town and have no cell-phone. You can also tak when the phone is being used and you have something importain to tell them, such as helping them with their homework. When there's no telephone reception between each other, they can still talk over one million people in the @LOCATION1 use these sights. People are wrong when they say it takes their time away from exercising. Many websights give good tips on how to lose weight. The show many dieting plans such as @PERSON3 or @PERSON1. Not only that, but they also have exercise plans. It's not the computer's fault, it's the people who @CAPS4't ""stick"" with exercising. Also, the computer reccomends many great gyms you can join, like @LOCATION2 fitness. @CAPS4't you think that's a good ""deal?"" @CAPS4't listen to those other people stick with my opinion that computers are benefits for everyone.

1032,1,"Computers and other devices are good for humans especially young people like myself because they are good for communication, keeping the attention of the and providing unknown information. In @CAPS3 letter, I will explain. Communication is key, and technology is close the best and fastest way to use communiocation. Cell phones provide calling usage of course, but they also allow you to text someone. If you have dinner with friends and your late, with text you can send them a message and they should get it in no time at all. Email allows you to do the same as text, but you can write longer messages. Something that's really good for communicating is video chat. If you have a relative that you haven't seen in a long time you can video chat and they can see you and you can see them. It's like talking to one another in person. Keeping a persons attention is critical. Technology does that with games, music from @NUM1's, computers, game systems and the newest way, iPod's and instructions on how to do something. Of course a teacher or parents can do that, but heaving or seeing instructions on a computer is so much more exciting, which brings me back to @CAPS3 topic of keeping a persons attention. Technological devices are more exciting than people teachers and definitely parents but do they offer more? Information is most likiely the most frequent reason in which technology is used. If a child has a project for school, they either use the computers or asks their parents. If the parents have no idea about the question their child just asked, they say, ""@CAPS1 it up on the computer"", if you havent already done that. So in a way the human race depends on technology, actually we do depend on technology. Computers cellphones, iPods, gamesystems, etc all include a little thing I'd like to call the internet. The internet has been around for a while, going from extremely slow to high-speed, and it is a magical place. It can provide you with directions,recipes, job offers, store locations show times for movies and much , much more. Although technology is used in everyday life from communication to searching for information it can slowly us the human race down. I mean most of us spend most of our time on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when we should be walking around are exercising, looking at the trees and the birds and communicating with family face ti face. Therefore, computers and other things are nice and all, but are the worth getting fat or loosing touch with your loved ones.",4,3,4,4,4
1034,1,"I support advances in technology because In the future. Our world will be run by computers people can learn about places and people that they can never afford to see for real, and lastly, this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly. Have you ever thoughtabout the future, I know I have, usually when you think future, you think nobody and lots of automated things. The fact is the world is turning into a pure run by technology and as we the people get smarter, so does the technology so what good will the future if none of us know how to work a simple peice of technology such as a computer, then how are we going to use the more complicated things then? Believe it or not our world within @NUM1 years will be run all on computers, you will not have to do antyihg but wil them. without computers, how would we know aobut all of the stuff that we know now. How would people know that egypt looked like @NUM2 year ago? they dont to be there they could just look it up on the computer and how just as must about it as if they went there. Also computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time.

I know that I would try to contact them on the computer. I love friends that live out of state and I enjoy talking to them so if we did not have the compuers that we do. these experts are sasying that we are going to drive across the country to talk to them, if you ask me htat is pretty tire consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope that you agree with me in keeping technology in our lives is important because of the future for people to learn nee things about places and people, and also to communicate with friends and family although I can se your part of view that kids are not getting enough exercise most kids that computers are also involved sport.",3,3,3,3,3
1039,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1.

It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now.",3,4,3,4,4

You @CAPS10't just assume computers are bad for us, you might be surprised. @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am going to explain to you why we need computers to do projects. Well, I @CAPS5 from personal experience, my social studies teacher always likes you to type your final draft. Also, using a computer makes your projects easier because @CAPS3 @CAPS4 fixes your mistakes, and @ORGANIZATION1 finds everything you need. I find it much more easy to use a computer for projects and I @CAPS5 all of my friends think it is also. If you aren't persuaded yet, keep reading because I @CAPS5 you will be eventually! Next @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you about making friends just with a computer. I @CAPS5 that parents these days are really happy when you have come home and made new friends. Just by using a computer you could easily go online, search friends you want to @CAPS11 to @CAPS5 better, and chat with them. (to make sure they are who you think!) The other day my friend @PERSON1 came up to me and said meet my friend @CAPS6 I met online! I was really happy for her and realized computers are helpful. Everybody needs friends that are there for them, and computers are the perfect conclusion for that! Last @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you more about why and how you could @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Do you @CAPS5 what @ORGANIZATION1 is? You @CAPS10 search @CAPS7 on @ORGANIZATION1! If you really wanted to @CAPS5 something and you were really curios you could search on @ORGANIZATION1! This is a great way to @CAPS11 educated. Also, computers help you with @CAPS12 @CAPS13 because everytime you are on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 typing a random story it will fix your mistakes, and you will learn off of these mistakes. So, to sum up this paragraph, a computer is @CAPS12 easy way to @CAPS11 @CAPS12 easy @CAPS13, and YOU need to keep computers to see for yourself. In conclusion, I was asked to write a paper to you seeing if I would like to keep computers or not. By now you @CAPS5 that I would like to. In case you are iffy about my reasons, I will simply restate them. @CAPS1, you need a computer for projects. Second, you @CAPS10 make friends. Last, you @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. All of these things are a huge benefit in laer life. Don't forget YOU @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13! That is whta everybody would like! I @CAPS5 you will come through to yourself and agree. Thank you for listening to me.",4,5,4,4,5
1066,1,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there is alot of talking and arguing about computers. Some say they are helpful to society and others say not. As for myself I am one of those on the side of which is for computers. I think the do alot less harm than good. First of all the hand-eye cordination of the user is mostly improved over a period of time, which helps withe learning musical instruments. Also it gives a great learning ability to people, particularly student. If there were computers, for a student to do a report he/she would have to read through an encyclopedia, which takes a great amount more time than plainly looking it up on the internet. Finaly computers are great for communicating with far-away friends or family. The first subject on my agenda is the hand-eye cordination skills. These skills are the ability to work with your hand and eyes simultaniously. There is a number of impacts these skills can make. The most apparent is musical instruments. If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar you must move your fingers to the notes coresponding with the screen. Another place where hand-eye cordination comes in handy is sports. One sport where hand eye cordination makes a huge impact is in football. If the ball is thrown then the wide recever must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball. I am also going to argue the vost world of learning that is provided by computers. Lets just say someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2 where would you go to find that answer? I don't know about you but I am definatley going to look it up on google (internet search engine). Also schools @CAPS1 can ask alot more of their students because they have all this information at there desposal. Lastly I would like to cover the communications abilitys that the computer puts out there. First of all let say you have a very close friend move out-of-state"" how are you going to keep in touch. You could try using phones but yet the long-distance fees have sky-rocketed over the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long distance for @NUM3 mins a day that would be over @NUM4 a month. in todays ecconmy you need to save money not talk it all away. The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each-other. So hopefully my letter will be able to surposs ""@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill"" to at least make it somewhere in the paper. People need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them.""",6,5,5,5,5
1070,1,"I think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because @CAPS1 has bad things online. @CAPS1 makes people stupid, and @CAPS1 makes you lazy. Those are the @NUM1 reasons why you shouldn't stay on the computer all day. One of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like kidnaps. I seen a lot of video and movies about kidnaps when an older men or women starts taking to some young kids and they go meet some place and the young teen or kid never comes back. Another reason is that the computer makes you stupid for example when I use to be on the computer all day I would get out to get something to eat and some times I would go in the bathroom to get food and then I notice that thats not the kochen @CAPS1 feels like I just woke up when I got off. My last reson is that computer makes you lazy. The computer makes you lazy because you just stay in the computer all the time sitting on the chair without sun light or exercise @CAPS1 will make you want to stay here more and its not good for you mind and body. These are my three reasons why you should not stay on the computer, the more you the more you will want to stay. So don't stay on the computer because there is bad things in there, @CAPS1 will make you lazy. Please don't stay on the computer for a long time.",3,3,2,3,3
1079,1,"Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a possitive effect on people because you could chat online. There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. And you can pay your bills on the computer. People that have no phone od don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website can chat to friends and family. Also many people that have websites like facebook, myspace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. And some people do find that @CAPS1 person that they been looking for. I think that they jusy come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn there alaphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling, This is a good product for little kids so they cam use the extra work over, the @DATE1 or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. One day I had my mother what she was doing and the light bill so i was like how can you and she said and a website bt I forgot what's it called and you could pay your bills right there. So instead of up going in your are go to a local show when thay pay bills and can like or if you get a computer you can do that in you home with no . So people who publish the newspaper I think and I hope you think to this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time.",3,3,3,4,4
1081,1,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change.",3,3,3,4,4
1083,1,I think that using computer is fine. Reason why I think you have family from far away. Instead of talking hearing voice on the phone. They can talk to each other but most of all see each other. Show cool thing you have that are new. When you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip. Computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car. You can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you. Also now you can buy food on internet and lots more. Saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money. Lots of dating sites to meet diffent people to go out and give your commets. Texting on facebook can let you save money by texting for free. Playing free online games with your friends. You can make website and you can watch movie and show online. There just a lot of thing you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside exercise but I agree with some expert. Lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. This techology people are big they don't go out more. They eat lots of food. But computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun. Those are my reason why I think that computer are great and sould be used more.,2,2,2,3,3
1085,1,"Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computer scientest have found cours for deseses, jobs have become easier and communication with friends or family have become afordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people on places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to phone without having to pay for anything. Is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could have them find afordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events. any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up and now computers can be as big as a flat screen @CAPS1 and you can turn them on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?",4,4,4,4,4
1092,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. ""You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond. (did not finish)",5,4,4,5,5
1098,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are several reason how computers have effect on people. My position is to convice the local newspaper why certain people @CAPS2't and @CAPS3 use computers. People getting caught up on the @CAPS4, or people not having enough money to explore the world, so they just be on the @CAPS4. In effect, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you will get caught up. For example, my friend @PERSON1 stay on the computer more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that his on a @CAPS5 line, hooking up with other people. He for gets about everybody. He's so on the @CAPS4. He stop going school, he gaining. Now he just a nobody. He just sit in front of his computer and do nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid @CAPS5 line. @CAPS8's not hard to find another in our city. @CAPS8's alot of beautiful young lady's out here to explore. Similary, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop losing their focus on important, and start paying attention on other things like the, was a great person. She was so successful. She make tons of money. Until she start losing her her job. She stop cause she was so stock on facebook. Facebook is like a place for a friend @CAPS6 you could meet other people from different @CAPS7 you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turn her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now. How she got fired, how she don't pay her bill, and how she moving into a. Sometimes websites make lose focus on important thing in life. Consequently, certain people @CAPS3 use computer because the @CAPS4 help you with certain things. In summation, @CAPS8 help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the @CAPS4. One time I sign up for this website that was called myspace. For moment I did got caught up on @CAPS8. Continue line.",3,4,3,3,3
1111,1,"Being a teen myself, my computer is something I don't think I would be able to live without. But is it holding me back from more important things? I think so. I feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now. For example with school research papers we imediatly go to the computers in order to find information when we could be using books and magazeens. With having the use of computers many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books. Also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment. For many people using a computer is a life style, it's something we tend to use more than religiously and that @MONTH1 not be the best thing. Children, teens and even adults get extremly addicted to computers. Teens and children use laptops and @CAPS1's everyday in order to do their school work, and to talk with friends. As well as parents/adults, they use it to get their work done and use it as a easy communication with co-workers. To this very day people have become very addicted to computers. I know for certain that in my family, my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. As I mentioned before computers are also pulling families further apart. There is less family time and comunication between family members these days, due to computers. Insead of spending time with the family, teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends. I bet if there was a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers I almost garentee it would be quite a large amount. I know the only true family time some families have without computers is dinner and that isn't much. Lastly many humans are not as connected to nature and as involved as they used to be. Using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature. Though there many advertisements and pop ups on the computer that inform us about how to take care of the earth properly, we so easily ignore them and remain playing on the computer than going outside and doing something to help make the world a better, clearer place. Not only is it just taking care of our earth, but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should. Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but I bet a great deal of it is. Like I said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer, I mean how would we communicate or do our work? But there are trulthfully other ways to do them that we just aren't very used to because of the fact that we are so attatched to them. I never really noticed till now that it is possible to live without a computer, and that so many people are missing increadable things such as family and nature because we are so addicted to the computers.",5,4,5,5,5
1113,1,"Click, click, click the mouse of a computer goes as you are searhcing throughout the internet. Computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, I believe that computers have a very positivr effect on people. Computers can touch kids to be social because first off computers are like an online phone, you can talk to people in so many ways, facebook caht, aim(chat),, myspace, twitter, skype, and a lot of others ways that i havent mentioned. Also I think is a teen or kid or even adult that is too nervous to talk to people on the phone or in person, and is socialy not their or painfully shy can start of by just chatting with people online. Once they feels more comfoatable, then they can start talking to the person on the phone or in person. For example, I once @MONTH1 this girl who was very sweet, but was painfully shy and everyone for it, so one day she decided to make an aim nad talk to poeple on it, and provove that she isn'e a annoying wherd girl that everyone makes her out to be. She turned out to be one of the nicestly funniest person I ahve hung out with in a while. Which how internet can help you. HAve you ever felt that computers sometimes make you more intellegent? Well, in my opinion I think that computers help out so much more than a book. If you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button. Ahving a computer is like your own personal handbook of veerything in the world. A lot of people these days study from the internet, I know I sure do. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 more people say, that computers are more helpful than books and can make you a lot more intellegent, because the internet has so much more deatil than books, and mor efacts. @PERCENT2 of kids that have a computer use it for homewrok. Computers is a great tool to use while you are doing your homework. I spend most of the day on my computer doing homework than off it. For example, say you have a report and you need facts on @CAPS1 @PERSON1, and where he was born. You would jus type in, ""when was @ORGANIZATION1 boen."" and born! There it is with the date exactly. Also if you having a piece of writing like your rough draft so why spend the time trying to write really neat and perfect? When you can just open up a word document and type it up. To sum everything up computers have deffenatly a positive effect on people from these three reasons, computers are a great way to teach kids hohw to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, But I understand where your coming from people are spending way to much time on their computer and less time exersising, but you can look up great ways to exersise on the internet and watch videos of people that have @CAPS2.V shows about exersising and do it with them on the computer. Remember, computers aren'@CAPS2 just a waste of time and way to will your brain cells. they have a very positive effect on you. ",5,5,5,5,5
1116,1,"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reason why I am against usage of computers. My @NUM1 reason why I am against usage of computers is, the negativity, like for example too many pop ups come on the website your own and then they mini little advertisments like ""@CAPS1 on me"" ""free trial"". And thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My seocnd reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called ""@CAPS2"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier thats not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is montoring, alot of parents dont watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inapproiate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fought beacuse they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dont always know what your clicking on and you can @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. So just have my opinions and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks.",3,4,4,4,4
1119,1,"Currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. Some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. However, I tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. People exploit most of their time on comptuers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? Many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism. This is one reason why the @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pair you'll recieve, you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercise. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we @MONTH1 learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our frinds in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1. Our families need help occasionally, but sometime we're not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. In conclusion, computers hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends.",5,4,5,5,5

1124,1,"Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do comently. People will be doing much better things, such as exercising or spending more time with family and friends. Both these things are better for people's body and mind, and one more useful later in life. Please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on computers. First, exercising is an exellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer. By cutting out at least some @ORGANIZATION1 these hours, people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 says that ""@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" @CAPS2 some free time being on the computer is taken away, people will reward themself by taking care @ORGANIZATION1 their bodies. Moreover, I tried not using my computer for a week, and it was a great experience because in that free time I learned how to do a back flip in gymnastics. There are so many possibilities in exercising @CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much. Second, @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on the computer, they get more experience with social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 says ""@CAPS2 people spend time with family and friends, they gain necessary social skills for later in life."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick-thinking skills. Spending time with people's family and friends in stead @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer is exremely beneficial. I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them. Clearly, it is better to spend less time on the computer, and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends. Some people @MONTH1 say people can talk to people online so this is social skills, but in fact people gain better social skills from person-to-person interactions because they must use quick thinking and their emotions too. Altogether, I strongly believe spending less time on the computer is the best way to stay heathy mentally and physically. Thank you for considering my opinion.",5,4,5,5,5

1132,1,"Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top @NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of @LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to american history.com to find good information about @CAPS1 alley @CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from @CAPS3.C @CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week.

So there is ups and downs but in the end, it dosen't matter how much you use the computer, you can get exersize at the same time thats why I think it is a benifits to have computers today.",3,3,3,3,3
1156,1,"To the editor of the daily newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages. Computers these days are being used way too much for useage of priveleges that we already have. While people are using the computer for random activities, they are not having any physical activity. Also emailing and facebooks are great websites to communicate with but people are checking emails all the time instead paying attention to when their parents get home from a long day at work. With this people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side tracked and forget to do homeworks. Computers are great invention but with todays society there are to many issues that aren't always being appointed. In the first place, people aren't getting the exercise that they need because they are playing on the computer or video chatting with a friend. About @NUM1 of america is obess so excercising should definitely be a priority but with these new websites and activities on the computer people are getting held back. With this, kids and adults are communicating in high end ways that waste too much time. The computers have so many stupid activities that are not needed which make us not excercise because many people think that the options and webpages are important and needed. Indeed computers are a technology that is needed but people are taking advantage of it too much by having their whole life in the computer instead of having it toward other things such as excercising and being healthy. In addition to computers taking away from excerscising they are also taking time away from your family. For example, @TIME1 when my dad got home. From a long day at work no @CAPS1 truly a bear hug that he was longing for because everyone was so interested in their email or what my sisters friend just said on facebook. Family is the most important part of your life and if computers are getting in the way, computer use absolutely has to be changed. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still talk to your family and give them hugs but when you rae talking to your sister through facebook eventhough there just in the next room. It is lobvious needs to be done. Computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than @CAPS1. Finally, computers take away family but also schoolwork and works. Most kids spend so much time on the computer and they to do their homework. This is unexeptable and can be away, kids and teenagers are always playing games, facebooking friends and video chatting making them realize at that they need to start their home work! A girl from @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1 time I was on facebook for the whole afternoon and then I realized I never started my @CAPS2 essay!"" This has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain. Moreover, yesterday I remember that I was video chatting my friend for @NUM2 hours and didn't start my homework until @NUM3! The computer evryone that goes it which is uneceptable. Without computers a negative affect people. off people exercising out with time in the computer which is unbelievable and terrible. Also they cut communication with your family making it rare to truly bond with them. With this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework. Overall computers are that make life that much more stressful. Thank you for listening.",5,4,5,4,4
1157,1,"In myopinion computers are a good sorce @CAPS2 imformation, camuni-cation and business computers make things easier. @CAPS2 example, instead of going to the libarary to get information on something, you can you use a computer. Computers are one of the most advance technology, you can search anything in the world. computers are also a huge help on a project @CAPS2 school or @CAPS2 work some peoples jobs, they are required to use computers. Computers are even good @CAPS2 learning about things you've never even heard of. Some people even take classes online. Computers could also be helpful to plan a vacation. computers are often used to comunicate with others, family, and friends. if you own a computer, you mostly likely have an e-mail, homepage, or @CAPS1 to keep in touch with people. There are even sites to meet newpeople. In my opinion, I think computers have a positive effect on people computers can be used @CAPS2 many things, they are a good sorce of technology. Computers could take much time off your hands, @CAPS2 example, you have a @NUM1 page essay due tomorrow, I'm sure it'd be way easier and faster to type it out than to write it and mess up, @CAPS3 typing a letter or paper, computers have ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" so if you mess up on a word, it will shaw you where you made your mistake to save more time.",3,3,3,4,3
1159,1,"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more that @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl. She woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @NUM5 out @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make.",6,5,5,5,5
1163,1,"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?",4,4,4,4,4
1165,1,"Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1 I am writing this letter to inform you that I think computers are a smart investment for a couple of reasons. The following are some reasons on why computers benifit society, they allow children to do homework with some help, children can talk to other friend and when children are board they can play games music on it. UGH! I don't get this sometimes I am sitting at the kitchen table tring to do my history homework but I don't know the year the revalotionary war was. @CAPS2 I go in my room turn the computer on and @CAPS6 there I go to google and look up what I need to know. This also benefits parents too because if they are doing the bills or something they don't have to be bothere, the kid could look it up and know it is @CAPS6! Finally all my homework is done but my computer is still on I'm going to see who is online that I can talk to and make sure I didn't miss any homework. Talking to your friends online could help you stay in contact with friends in other states or just people you don't see very often. This can help make new friends or make friendships closer and cause less problems. Alright no body is home or online @CAPS2 I think @CAPS3 going to kick back turn some music to kick back turn some music on and maybe take a nap. Or I can play the new counter strke game I got ! YEAH on playing counter strike. Least death on my team that game! Alright thats enough of counter strike for the day I think I'm going to turn same music on and lay in bed. Now that I have told you all of the benefits of computers You @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6! keep in mind that it can help with homework, talking with friends, or just having some fun.",4,3,4,4,4
1167,1,"How do you think the world would be without computers? I think it would bring us back a couple of ages. We need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn. Without computers our country would be nothing. People say you don't get enough exercise and don't enjoy nature enough. Well there are ways to do that too. Communication is one of the greatest things about computers. Teenagers love to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 eachother when there at home because its so fast its like really talkiing to them. @CAPS1-@CAPS2 is another thing people love to use. Bosses of companies use @CAPS1-@CAPS2 to send @CAPS10 to everyone so they're all on the same page. There is also a new video chat were you can talk face to face with someone and see them from the other side of the world if you wanted to. You can also learn all you need to know on computers. They have dictionary sites, history sites, encyclopedia sites, etc. You can find any certain time in history and have a whole site on it. Or a site called wikipedia you can look up a certain thing and get a whole web page dedicated to the info of that object or person. Schools also use sites to help students have their knowledge. They have math sites, english sites, @CAPS3 studies sites, and (a science teacher favorite) @CAPS4 @CAPS5 for everything you need to know about science. They also have lots of websites for help with a new language. There is a recent program out caled @CAPS6 @CAPS7 that is on the computer but teaches you any language as well as any human teacher. Some people still say its not enough. They say you still need exercise, nature, and time with your family. You can still do all that on computers. You can look up certain workouts that you might want to do. You can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live. They have websites (like @CAPS8) were you can @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @CAPS11 pictures, play games, and video chat with your family members who @MONTH1 be living across the world from you. But you canstill do it. Even though I explained a lot of reasons why computers are a great thing to have, there are still a ton more. The teach hand eye coordination and many other things too. You can check sports scores from the night before or check sports score from @NUM1 years ago. You can do all this on the computer and more. This is why computers have a positive effect on people and everyone should have a computer.",5,4,4,4,4
1174,1,"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you know long of time spent on technology could result in cancer? ever since they were invented, computers have been advanced more and more even years. People, especially children, forget the risks of physical health. Family and friends and even mental health. Obesity rate is over to @LOCATION1, the highest it has ever People wouldn't even know technology is to blame. @CAPS2 you know the average @CAPS3 teenager spends at least @NUM1 hours on the computers? Think off all the calories that build up without exercise. If people could limit their at risk for diabetes. Diabetis is one of the most common disease involved with technology besides obesity. @NUM2 @CAPS4 are diabetic which means we are not at a safe health rate. If you limit computer use to @NUM3 hour a day, and work out atleast @NUM4 minutes a day, think of how healthy you will be you will have more healthy you will be you will have more energy, and mental focus, sleep wont be an issue, and you will be more physically attractive. Computers also lead friendship torn apart. cyber bullying is also a problem. @NUM4 of students are cyber bullies. This means that friendship will wont see each other if they spend all day on the mental health when they turn on the computer. @CAPS2 you know some forms of cancer are caused by the radiation of technological devices? Radiation eats away the brain causing altsimers, and other mental disease that snew at old age. Young adults in school also got used to texting. @PERCENT1 of students text and @PERCENT2 get used to terrible spelling, thats @PERCENT3 who accidentally write ""thru, lazy, or even native @CAPS5 during school."" This is the mental if of technology taking over. So as you can tell computers affect health, socializing, and even mentality. So don't be part of the problem, please, stop overuse of technology.",4,4,4,4,4
1175,1,"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more.",6,5,5,5,5
1176,1,"Dear newspaper I hear the more and more people use computers and I think thats so awesome because people talk online with other people. @CAPS5 they teach you how to use a computer. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Computers it the more advanced technology so its @CAPS1 the people is using it. I love to be in the computer all day because I always enter to @CAPS2 and talk online. @CAPS4 example some people like to talk with a family member the is not in the @LOCATION1 so they communicate from the computer. Sometimes I talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2 because I have @NUM1 years I dont see her. So I think talk online or using the computer is important. @CAPS4 example even grandma have @CAPS3 and she talks online with her family members. I think the using the computer is not a bad benefit because it helps you be in communication with your family or friends. That is why I think the people is wrong saying the or is not. Secondly, it teach you hand-eye coordination my grandma is old but computer and @CAPS4 example my grandma a nice hand eye coordination because when she goes to the letters she just ress and all she is correct. think computers have a effect on people. It @CAPS5 helps people write better and better. @CAPS4 example I love and when it write I dont need to go to other I write king of @CAPS5 the helps me with my eye and hand @CAPS6 is the it helps you find faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example on @ORGANIZATION1 you find what ever street you want. It @CAPS5 help you find in the computer about people. @CAPS4 example if I have a project I find the information on @ORGANIZATION1 about people or places. The computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people. I think is a positive effect on people. Finally, I think the computers are great benefits society. One reason is the you could talk online with people. @CAPS5 it teach you hand-eye and the helps your brain and sight. It @CAPS5 helps you at your hand movements. @CAPS6 reason is the give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example I have a project in @CAPS7 and I have to learn and search about forensic doctor and I search everything on the computer. I think the computers help your brain think more and computers are advanced technology. So I think their benefits our society.",4,4,4,4,4

My second reason to this situation is that it takes away knowledge. For one you might forget what you learned. Seconds toturing @MONTH1 be needed because you couldn't focus. @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 even forget the people you know even where you live if you spend to much time on the computer. @CAPS1 reason to this situation is that it takes time away from your family and friends.",3,3,3,3,3

Finaully three you will never see your family or friends if your on the computer. The first reason was computers have a bad effect on people is it can really hurt your eyes. If your always stareing at a computer screen all the time you can go blind. And with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes. The second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home. Like you can be watching adult movie that little kids are'nt aged enough to see if can have a bad effect And it has a bad effect on people because you will have no and if you have a little kid in your house he will always be in and he will probaly hear something really, really kid like music, @CAPS3 if you have a kid house The reason was computers have bad effects on people is that if your always on a computer you will never see your family and @CAPS3 if you are always on the computers you will miss out on the And will never you never see and don't @CAPS3 a rent on on the computers. @CAPS3 what you look And keep the little kid with you in the house.

Well I the computers are takeing up people time (like children) and not letting them get their work done. Also, computer are not only letting people talk to their friend, but its causing @CAPS5 bullying. Finally, @CAPS1 are also just maken parents more stressed out because the have to pay another bill for internet. Children now and days come home change and log right into the computer and start talking to friends and lisening to music all this sounds good intell their report cards come back and they see they are failing half there classes. I remember when my friend @CAPS3 would go home change eat and log right inside the computer. As days went around the end or the year was she noticed she had two problems. She was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes. She noticed that getting on the computer was not neccesary so for the next mouth and a half she cut down on her time on the @CAPS1 did her homework and started this pushed me to beleave that children have @CAPS1. Proven by @PERSON3 the syber bully that over @PERCENT2 of children have bin syber bullyed or @CAPS5 bulllied someone. All this happen when children are not being watched or get bored and to pick on someone. What should we do people ask @PERSON1 and she says well take away the @CAPS1.

1190,1,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a waste of time! People that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse. Some people say they are good for research and talking to people. Both of these things you can do without a computer. Computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper then using the computer. In this economy why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same thing also on a computer you don't really talk to the person you are really just typing word to them. This can be very dangerous. Who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think. Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercize. If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obecety is already rising with the number of fast food places and computers are making it worce. And the worst part is parents don't care some children go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day and there parents don't encorige them to go outside. Children need encorigment to get moviing or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this or before you no it @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obeise. Another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this @MONTH1 be true there are other way you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also not everything on the internet is true so you might have false information. By getting a book you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them over night it @MONTH1 take a month or two but if we act new we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without then very easily, and without them the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer. If you are stuck on a computer for @NUM1 hours a day you will never have any family memories. All you will remembor is when you were on the computer, and who wants that.",4,4,4,4,4
1191,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you think that children spend to much time on the computer. The issue that is going around is @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books @CAPS2 the same thing. I know alot of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more to on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk it was said that, ""In @LOCATION1 people are alot over wieght"", and it was also said that the number of over wieght people in the world was the of @LOCATION2"". So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye. You could be out side learning hand eye coordination. Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around haveing fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're finsh the start playing games or the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can @CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your disicion. @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exerciseing the they @CAPS2 on the computer. Now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know. ",5,5,4,5,5
1198,1,"Dear to whom this @MONTH1 concern I know everybody that dont uses computers are why are people effect by the computers. Well i think computer is better then newspaper, on news papers you could find the news, well of course but wheather, houses for sale, tv casting, jobs and others just the same way as @CAPS1 but instead it like virtual. It benefits society for certain reasons it depends. some times computerscan be a negative effects on people but it also teach people how to read, write, type, learn and other. What I about we can talk to others we can see pictures of people whom we no we can google into about things we need to no, it helps when they need to find they way around the mapquest. A negative issue with having computers with internet, certain websites that are not age able. Kids be on website thier parents dont bout, looking up with boys they meet over the @CAPS1, People dying making plans with someone the next day the person is gone missing. I think if experts take away computers must kids well be mad and upset and there will be nothing more to do but play video games and go outside and these are my opinions.",2,2,2,2,2
1200,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has been brought to my attention that why on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside. The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers, rather than enjoying the day. Computers are negatively affecting the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutley crazy if nothing is done about this. For one the @LOCATION1 has the most obese children in the world. Generally children should be running around burning off their calories; even some people in their teen years should. Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such. Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day. The whole screen thing brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain, what computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child ceizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer, with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that everytime you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk. The longer youre on the more and more and more radiation is going to youre brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself, it could almost be called suicide because if youre reading this than you've been warned. So we've basically covered the effects that computers have on your body physically. The computer can also effect you mentally and socially. When @DATE1 comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose @PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school. Its been proven that computers cause memory loss. So what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on, frustrating isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could've gained knowledge rather than using it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer, would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. Its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you.",5,5,5,5,5
1201,1,"Dear editor, Computers are becoming more and more prevalent in the @LOCATION1. Peolple are spending too much time on computers instead of on other activities, an effect not beneficial to society. Because of computers, people have lacked exercise, missed enjoying nature and other parts of the world and forgotten about interacting with family and friends. Computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives. First of all, computer users receive significantly less exercise than those who do not use computers. According to a survey done by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only @PERCENT1 of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week. In contrast, @PERCENT2 of non-computer users (non-frequent computer users) reported that they exrcised at least once every week. Can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user? Nearly everybody would be overweight, lethaigic from lack of sleep due to hours on the computer, and unworldly. Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone's life, and lacking it could be deleterious to one's health. Hopping off the computer and instead getting exercise, would make for a healthier and more fit country. Not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise, but they also prevent people from enjoying nature and other parts of the world. By traveling to @CAPS1 and unfamiliar places in the world, one is able to experience and learn about other cultures. Going on the internet @MONTH1 be a decent way to learn about other places, but actually feeling the ambiance and environment of a foreign place is allows for a much more profound understanding of another place. For example. when I went to @LOCATION2 for a vacation, I learned about the differences in traditions and culture. I saw the separation between the poor and the rich when I lookes from humble sharks along the river to the portentous, eregant edifices scraping the sky. It was an experince I could not encounter on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer, but through the screen of one's eyes. Lastly, computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends. From my personal experiences, I tend to ignore friends and family. Speaking, playing, and generally socializing with others is a critical part of everyone's life. Without this basic necessity people cannot be happy. In summary, computers should not be used in excess. This sort of use could read to people getting less exercise, not fully experiencing the world, and closs of interaction with friends and family. To make a better country and nation, the people of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce computer use.",5,6,6,6,6
1204,1,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS2 I have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly disagree, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Having computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about @CAPS3 and faraway places and even allow people to talk online with friends or family. Don't you want your children to grow up with great hand-eye coordinatio? More than @PERCENT1 parents voted yes. As shown in many statistics, adults and children that use the computer for an hour or more a day have better hand-eye coordination than a normal adult or child that only uses @CAPS6 once a week. By using the computer for more than one hour a day your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase. Not only does typing quicker effect your computer techniques but @CAPS6 also helps you outside of your home like in sports. For exsample, if you play the sport baseball, the speed of your pitch will increase over @PERCENT2 if you use the computer for over a hour a day! If your a batter your racation to the pitch will also increase by over @PERCENT2! Just by using computer. Is time running out for your @CAPS3 project to be do? Without computers, you wouldn't get the information you need quick enough. Dr. @DR1 from @ORGANIZATION1 state ""You can get the same information on people other countries, and @CAPS3 from the computer as you can . By using the computer you get the as a book and easy. In addition, you have to buy books to get their information unlike computers where they dont you look up the you and in expensive, dont settle for less get the best! Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with. By having a computer you can chat with them through your webcam! Instead of calling them up or sending them an email you could chat with them and still see them in the flesh! Several computer owners say, ""@CAPS5 like your actually hanging out with them!"" @CAPS6 takes over @NUM1 days at least to recieve a letter back or an email from them if they live faraway with computers @CAPS5 instant ! Wouldn't you like to talk to friends and family every day instead of waiting around for a call, email, or letter? I think yes. All in all , having computers is a great investment. I would also like to point out that without computers you wouldn't beable to talk with friends/family online, get better hand-eye cordination, or even have the ability to learn about @CAPS3 in just a click of a button! Isn't this what you want? ",5,5,4,4,4
1207,1,"Dear editor, Have you ever used a computer? Odds are you have, which means you know how convienient and positive computers are. Did you know @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 use computers regularly? These technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn, showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people. Who hasn't ever played a game on a computer? Computers provide many forms of entertianment, such as games, music, and videos. I once has to drive @NUM1 hours to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer, that I played games and watched movies on. Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities. Of course, try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling @NUM2 @CAPS2, which is computers positively affect me. It was @NUM3 on a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was just about to have a baby. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were there to witness this baby coming into the world because the all live on the other side of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS3, this minor set back did not prevent them from seeing the @LOCATION1 baby, and thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer many ways to be social, such as social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born. there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convienient for all. Last but not least, computers are not only a fine tool for school, but are necessary to succeed with your education. One snows day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. Too bad I didn't know one thing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to take out some books for my report but due to the snow, the library's power went out and therefore they were closed. This was not an issue, though, beacuse I only had to spend @NUM5 minutes on a computer searching for information, instead of spending hours browsing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many helpful purposes for people. These marvelous machines can provide entertainment, socialize with people around the world, and even provide information on any topic you would like. @ORGANIZATION1 readers, now you understand why computers are positive for your lives and everyone elses. I encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone, so they know all the benefits to using computers.",5,5,4,5,5
1211,1,"Dear editor: @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION2 have comuters? These computers are definatley benefitting society. People need computers to get updated on important issues, contact others and learn new information. Computers are neccisary for everyday life. It's very important that news gets around, and one way for it to do that is by computers. Average people like me and you need to know the weather, global issues and many other important topics. If you use the computer to get updated on important issues you will be able to acess the information right away. For example there is no need to wait for the weather to come on the television when you can find out the weather for your local area withen seconds. Just recently there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and million of civilians died. if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in @CAPS2 people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated. Not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues but it is also a great way to contact people. My relatives live very far away and we can't afford the long distance phone call charge and so we e-mail them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people contact far away friends and family by e-mail! The computer is also a great place for friends to contact each other through social networking sites, such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. People need to interact with other people and the internet is a fantastic place to do that. Finally computers can also be used to learn new information. If children need to find inforamtion for a project or essay the can easily search the internet and find an answer. Kids need to acess the information that is neccisary for school on the internet. Computers are useful for adults as well. If adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer. It's so much easier than going out to the library and finding that information in a book. @CAPS1 you know that most adults use an online dictionary to find the definition to a word? Computers can find every answer to your questions. In conclusion, computer are really benefitting society. Computers can update you on important issues, help you contact people, and find out new informatiuon. These avandces in technology are good for human society.",5,4,4,4,4
1226,1,"Dear Newspaper, I personally believe that new technology is a great thing. That’s why I think that computers have positive effects on our society. Some of these effects include developing skills to help people for present or future, getting a better education and helping people to become more social. Computers can help people in so many ways you just have to realize it. So come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use. My first reason of why I feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one has and @MONTH1 not realize. For example a teenager @MONTH1 say while typing a paper that she really likes to write. So, she @MONTH1 go on the internet start looking at different styles and maybe she could become a famous journalist. It's all from the skills she got going online and searching what she enjoys. Another situation could be that a man applies for a job and then the employer' says he has to know how to use different softwear, so he could go on the computer and look for a tutorial on that specific softwear. A computer @MONTH1 help people build skills now and for their own future. My second reason of why computers can have positive effects on people is that it can help them get a better education. Any adult who hasn't gone to college and wants to can take classes online and earn their degree way. The education is just for adults; kids can go online and research history of different places they live and want to go. The great thing about you is you can find the information fast and easy. Computers help people learn more and get a better education for themselves. My final reason of why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social. There are so many ways to connect with family and freinds. You can send an email to someone and wait for a reply. Or now, you can even instant message somebody and talk to them like there in the same room. There are also websites, such @CAPS1 facebook, where you can get together and talk with old friends. Computers can help everyone connect with anyone @CAPS1 you can see computers have so many positive effects on people. They can help you build social skills for now and for our future. They can also help people get a better education. Plus, it is a great way to connect with past and present friends. Hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people.",5,5,4,4,4
1229,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think that computers have a positive or negative affect on people's lives? Well if you think it is negative I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand-eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. First, computers teach good hand-eye coordination. While you use computers you are improving your hand-eye coordination. One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger, you move the mouse and click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand-eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all. In fact the are the best bet for a better future.",5,5,5,5,5
1234,1,"More and more people use computers everyday. Computers are a great help for projects, email, vacation spots, and so on. However, some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer instead of excercising, or taking a walk. I think that computers are an important part of a persons life because the information found on a computer is very useful. It can be useful to you when you have a report coming up. What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do, you don't have time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and get all the information I need. I would also use a computer to learn about far away places, or even famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it. Like, you could find where the best resturant locations are, the best holers, and even the best tourist spots. Computers are also helpful for chating. My grandparents moved so I don't talk to them that much anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick e-mail saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! Thats a lot of work to write down! At some works, the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything thats going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an insentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with. Playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax. Computers are a great help for reports, vacations, chatting, information to help you study for a test. Also to play games on. A lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs. I think computers are an important part of a persons daily life.",4,4,4,4,4
1237,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people think that computers are used too much, and are helping people become over weight, and even obese. This is maybe true, but computers also teach hand eye coordination, give people the oppertunity to learn about far away places, and people can even coordinate on them! Over all I think computers effect people in a positive way, and these are some reasons why. Computers help teach hand eye coordination. I know your probably thinking “huh? How do computers do that? All your doing is staring at a screen.” But to your dismay computers do teach hand eye coordination. It does this because while playing games, people watch the screen, and click with their hands. They don’t just stare at the mouse while they play these games. By doing so, it teaches hand eye coordination. Scientist have provine that people who own a computer and use it at least @NUM1 hours a week, have better coordination that people who don’t own a computer by @PERCENT1! Just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone. Hand-eye coordination is a thing. It helps you play better in sports like baseball, and not only that but it helps future jobs. As you can tell, @CAPS1, without computers out hand eye coordination. People think that computers are only used for games, but in reality, they teach us @CAPS2 things about the world. Without computers people would know about nearly anything that’s going in other countries. For example, the other day, my mom was checking her email and came access the stay of a young, starving. That are story changer her anyday life because takes food for granted. Without computer my mom would have more in other countries. Because we live in the @CAPS4.S what’s going on in other countries. Are less fortanite, but computer help remind and teach us what’s going in the world everyday. One of the main advantages about computers is they allow people to communicate through them. Even my grandmother said the, without computers, I wouldn’t be as close to you as I am today. “@CAPS5 and my grandmother use the website skype.com. This websit allows you to not only talk to the other person, but to see them too! Because of site like these. I’m allowed to stay in contact, and be able to see my grandmother who lives faraway. Without computers this wouldn’t be possible. Not only do computers let you talk to people far away, but people close too. I often find myself asking friends over the computer, what the homework is, or whens the next test, etc. Computers make it easier to connect to people near and far. In conclusion, computers help in all different ways. The world would be upside down without them. They give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, teach hand eye coordination, and allow people to communicate with each other. Computers have @CAPS2 flaws, but they also have so @CAPS2 positive effects too that I think they shine over all the tiny flaws. Thank you",4,4,4,4,4
1241,1,"Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well @CAPS1 not this article gives you information about all of this. First, alot of people don't like computers because they say ther're to confusing. Actually computers are'nt that hard to work you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to it. Also, computers can make things easier like typing. why should you right @CAPS1 you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper. Secondly the internet is very easier then books. All you have to do is go to @ORGANIZATION1 any other search engine type what your looking for in and in a split second you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also @CAPS1 your planing a vacation the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web. Also, you can back hotels and look at live pictures with more than just . So when you back a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts. I remeber the time when I bought @MONEY1 shoes @MONEY2 online. Also it usually ships to your house in a couple of days . Lastly going on it alot isn't bad. I go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too. I can do this because at night when one one can go outside I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What @CAPS1 your mom or dad wnet on a @NUM1 weeks buisiness trip. You could use your webcam and talk to them and see than like @CAPS1 you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so @CAPS1 it is that helpful and easy to work with.",3,3,3,3,3
1244,1,"Deear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a @CAPS1 thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what person are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a @CAPS1 effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. They just sit there playing games also about @PERCENT1 of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are probally pating well their on the computer which that is why some people @MONTH1 be fat. Most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @NUM1's and @NUM2's some are in there @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Just sitting there on the computer will get you. Where in life. It will not give you a job or school education. By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side. If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. Being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college, kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends you could get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours, the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eles. Well all of the kids grade through @NUM7 grade should go out a play with their toys and people @NUM8 grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like I sometimes go on facebook. Other people go on facebook, google, games looking up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is youtube and listen to music and watch veidos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people shoud be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and probally will get to fat. So the effect of computers on people is @CAPS1.",4,4,3,4,4
1260,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in the @NUM1 grade in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 In @LOCATION1. I'm writing to you because I heard that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In @CAPS1 opinion I think it benfit society. If you keep reading I will fell why it benif society. @CAPS1 first reason that computer have a positive effect on people. For example, when I see @CAPS1 older brother go on the computer he look much smarter on it. That @NUM2 out of @NUM3 member of @CAPS1 family learn thing from the computer. @CAPS1 second reason that it teach hand eye coordination. For example, when I play games in the computer @CAPS1 hand are the ones doing every thing for me. (@PERSON1 example is that we I wacth the game @CAPS1 hand are roating) @CAPS7 @NUM4 of @NUM3 of human play games in the computer and let their hand do everything. @CAPS1 third reason that it give people the ability to learn. For example, when I was using the computer use too teach so much that I'm go on most of the time. @NUM6 of @NUM3 student study in computers and they learn about thing that they never knew. Also they have the ability learn more on the computer. Some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer. However, I said that computer help people learn about thing that happen in the word. For example, they could larn about the war that going on and how people are risking their life for this cause. In conclusion, In @CAPS1 opinion it benefit society. Computer have a positive effet, I theach hand eye, and it give people the ability to learn. I think you should put all you support in the problem.",3,4,3,3,3
1263,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that more people should start using computers. They can offer things that just writing things down or a pece of paper cant, like being able to learn about things that aren't taught in school, you can talk with friends online and you can keep everything in one. The first reason I think more people should use computers is that they can learn about things that arent taught in. Such as current events, the history of our nation and how our government works. Now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on @CAPS1 or a newspaper. But the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video. Also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on @CAPS1. Another reason I think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet. This is great because there @MONTH1 be people you havent seen in awhile because they moved. I had a friend who moved to pitsburg when I was @NUM1 and when I got u @CAPS3 account I was able to find him and talk with him a while of him visiting. Or you can just keep in touch with friends that so to a different school. The last reason I think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures, videos, document and contacts on your hard time. This is important to because I am not very well organized when it comes to school. But I started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer. This helped me be less clutteres and keep all my work in our place. It also means you can email that walk to a teacher or notes a friend who might have missed school that day. So in conclusion that or why I think we should have peple we computers more. They can help you learn, let you talk with friends, or let you keep everything in one place. That is why I think more people should use computers.",3,3,3,3,3
1266,1,"Guess what! Do you like to use computers well I do and I think it benfits society for a couple of reasons. It is good to use to get information on things, to meet people and just to expose the internet and if you keep on reading @CAPS1 ill tell you why think that. One reason I think it benfits society because how in this lifetime you need to know what is going on in the world. So instead of you always watching the news or reading newspaper. You could go on the internet and see what is going on from the internet. Thats why I think it benfits society today. A second reason is haveing a computers poeple get to talk over the web and meet new poeple. Being able to talk online to people like faimly and your friends. That you havent seen or heard from in a long time. And you don't have thier number you will tot alk to them during they are on the internet. A third reason is haveing a computer and is always on it. You can explore the internet and get facts on poeple, things, and places that you never knew about and from you going on the internet you learn more things that tou never knew before. A fourth reason is by haveing a computer you can go to school on the internet. And you dont have to leave your house because you can go to school from there and by doing that most poeple could stay out of trouble because there not leavinf there house. Unfortunally I ahve to end this letter but has mush reasons and details I gave ou on why I think haveing a computer is a good idea. You will agree with me and why I think that.",3,3,3,3,3
1273,1,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chating on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative, so in aim a problem I still have yet to find out. I asked question like ""what do you do at home?"", ""are you a computer geek?"". (@CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a comcast commercial) and some who don't know what a computer is (not commenting). I am here to teach about the benifits of exercising and not the un natural ways of a computer. Did you know people can loose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse dont believe me try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get , give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick for example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorsed the depression effected his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1 @CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infecte and could have ended his life. I believe this was from lacks of communication and this happens everyday to everyone just open your eyes and relise what a computer can do to a man or woman. (@CAPS5 was remaried to bonnie and now carrys a scars on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many, do people spend to much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neibor see what they think. I relly hope you consider my argument.",4,4,5,5,5
1278,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people not great but its good for many reasons, for now I have three reason why its good, my reasons are, search new places meet new people, when people have nothing to do, and teenagers that cant be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they dont have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they dont have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also thre are many websites of movies. My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer. teenagers are teenagers they must have technology. If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop. This is my opion on the effects computers have on people.",3,3,3,3,3
1282,1,"Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have and use computers everyday. Computers are killing us as a nation. We need to put a stop to this abuse of computers. Millions of parents and kids spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer. They are either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 games and other types of games out on the internet. Kids use these as entertainment. But having an @NUM2 year old child playing a game with guns is certainly unnacceptable. Kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they don't even think of playing sports or going outside. Therefore, the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air. This can lead to obesity or other weight issues. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, so why keep these horrid games out there? The last thing @LOCATION1 needs is more kids becoming fat!! There are two ways to use a computer for good and for bad ways to use them for good can be for planning a vacation, or working at a job, or even to look at a child's grades online. But many kids and parents don't use computers for these reasons. Kids have been caught looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking into systems and other criminal type things. The computer is a way to do things that you shouldn't, while keeping your identity hidden. For example, whever I sign-up for a website subscription so I can play a game, it asks me for personal information. It askes for my name, my address, my phone number and other things. So what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info. So a computer hacker or a fraud site can't steal my personal info. And who are we to know that people don't do this with illegal programs? Computers are dangerous to @LOCATION1's well-being. On top of obesity, there have been reported cases of a child or parent having a seizure, having the picture of a game implanted in their eyes because they don't take their eyes of the game. There has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his/her parents in rage. Computers turn kids and parents into wild beasts. Parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games. In some cases, the parent destroys an account on a website or takes a computer away for a certain ammount of time. These actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane! Cases have been reported of smashing computers, doing bad in school, killing parents as I said earlier and in some cases suicide. So in conclusion, computers are a source of health issues, action issues and mental issues. If we want @LOCATION1 to be restored to the @LOCATION1 we all love, then we the people, must put a stop to this computer addiction!",5,4,4,4,4

One way computers benefit society is it doesn't make people stand arcuna a book store or libray hours at a time. Another way computers benefit society is by letting people chat with people all over the over world. The last way that computers benefit society is it teaches people handeye coordination. If you have ever been to a bookstore or library you @CAPS1 how hard it is to find the book your looking for. Instead of spending hours on your feet @CAPS2 go sit on your computer for ten minuets or less. On the computer you can get any information about any information about anywhere or anything. one book about @LOCATION1!

1289,1,"The effect people shouldn't be on the computers that much because you need exercising to keep you healthy. You wouldn't be learn anything if you play games on it all day. Your brain will be fousing on the computers than school. You would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this. It will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers. The effect on people on the computer by not knowing technology is some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain instead of a computers have information in your brain if you are smart. Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard technology and country some of them don't even have technology or electrion because they can't afford for a computers. The effect that they don't know technology is they can find location and no cellphone you can call your friend go online and listen to music, play games chat to friend and family. Play games with each other. And watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on. Click on intert explorer and search on a website to go on it's kind of hard to use the keyboard and typing it fast. The last effect is talking to people that you don't know form online. Is playing the game with a diffrent player you can chat with that person. Conulison this is all my reason why I agree with the effect of a computer have postive reason for a lot of people. This is why I agree with the effect of the computer.",2,2,2,2,2
1290,1,"Personally I think computers have a good influence on people. There one of the greatest inventions.With computers you can listen to music or watch @CAPS1, research things for your projects, or just have a good time. Computers help people create, listen to, watch and make music and @CAPS1. When you have a computer you can get influenced by other musicians to create music. And where does eating that music need to go? Into a computer to add beats and different vocals. You can also watch @CAPS1 on there! Not exactly @CAPS1 but whatever show you'd like to see. Some people even create movies on special programs. Thats not all though. Alot of questions can be answered on the computer by doing research. Cures for different disease like cancer can be found. Even small research projects like ""Who founded @CAPS2"" can easily be found with one quick google search. Yeah we might be getting lazy but it makes peoples lives simpler. For instance intead of reading through dozens of books you could just search it on the internet for the answers. You can even take classes online not impressed? Another great effect of people on computers is socializing and having fun. Socializing over computers @MONTH1 not be as effective as socializing in person but it gives the quieter people. like me , a chance to say whats on their mind. Plus there wont be any of those akward silence moments like there usually seems to be on the phone. Oh, did I mention facebook. On how I love facebook. I get to keep in touch with my family and friends I no longer see. I used to have a very close friends, but after we switched schools I never heard from her. Until I found her on facebook. Same with many other people. And for the younger ones they'll be bored with the billions of games online. How could you go wrong? Sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people. But what do you guys think. Can one big negative out weigh a ton of positve? I think not.",4,4,4,4,4
1292,1,"Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors.",4,4,4,4,4
1296,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have some opinions on technology is going these days and about how many people shun the idea of further advancement for the understandable reasons that it brings people away from family and that it draws people's attention away from the rest of the world I do see their point but I'd like to make a point myself. While statistics show a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities people also find more things to do and now that the world is more concerneD for the environment you will probably see people coming outside again because they heard about some new environmental actavist group to join or they watch a movie that makes fun of live action role playing and decide to give it a whirl. My point being that you never know what your going to discover in the media and its better than sitting outside all day with no insperation, waiting for your parents to get home and give you information from outside you tiny world. The other item I will mention is the music industry and how it is revolutionized with more advanced, and different ways of listening to it in fact the only problem in music today are the artist and how they take advantage of recording studies and on occasion another just to gain fame! Without doing anything but sit back and lip sync. But the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now. So why not advance and invest in the music industry, it will provide entertainment and fun for years to come. Advanceing technology is the music industry actually is probably good for the economey as well I mean if we didn'@CAPS4 have new @CAPS3 to bell to people every year that would be a huge decline in stock market prices not that were not in a crash right now but it wouldn'@CAPS4 be any better. That goes for cell phones too and any other piece of hardware that gets frequently upgraded it's just good for buisness. You see I belive that the point of life is joy so whats better than settling down with mabey a date some candlelight and a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V most people will enjoy just sitting down and watching the telly it's easy to relate to. The television has evolved in many good ways it's a way to lay down and unwind learn about so many different things mabey watch a show on @LOCATION1 it makes you feel like being there without actually being there.

1297,1,"Dear @CAPS1-republican, @CAPS2 do benifit society in a positive way, but they also have a negative affect. Computers allow people to chat/voice chat/video chat with family members in other countries that would be very expensive or impossible over the phone. They also provide learning experiences with many resources at your finger tips. One posotive affect of computers is that they allow you to connect with people around the world. Programs like skype and allow you to video/voice/ chat to people around the world at no cost. Doing such the phone would be very expensive. It gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see. Another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides too you. The internet has just about every piece of information possible. Doing a research paper go to wikipedia and topics you'l find information. The internet can prove to be helpful. The @CAPS2 offers you many good mind/puzzle games that you could not ordinarily do. There are alot ;of good things on the internet. Many things that help get your mind flowing. Cant afford the newspaper? Read articles and stories right on the internet. The last reason I believe @CAPS2 have a positive affect on people is because it replace. Many people, instead of going to the @CAPS3 will go to the @CAPS2. No matter what are you doing, you are usually doing more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1. That is why I think computers make a posotive affect on people. Computers are sure to be our future. You can play games, voice/video chat and even read the newspaper.",3,4,3,3,3
1302,1,"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have both possitive and @CAPS12 effects on people. However, I believe that there are more positive effects than @CAPS12. Some of these positive effects would be that they are essential for education, a very usful place to communicate, and they can be fun. My first reason for supporting computers would be that they are very eduactional. For example, you can research almost anything. If you are doing your homework and you forgot an answer. An other reason why @CAPS1 is educational is because you can type your paper on @CAPS1 so your teacher can actually read your handwriting. If @CAPS1 is messy. On the subject, you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation. But how do you get @CAPS1 to your boss? Email of course! wich brings me to my next subject; @CAPS2. Another resoursful thing about computers is @CAPS2. There are so many different ways to communicate; @CAPS1's unbeleivable. Take I @CAPS4 for an example. You can @CAPS5 to peoples cellphones. You can @CAPS5 to other people that are @CAPS7 or you can just @CAPS5 on some websites such as @CAPS9, @CAPS10, and tons more. You can also vidio chat with people on things like and @ORGANIZATION1. Those are just a few ways of communicating on the computer. Finally, I would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers. First, you can buy games from a store and download them onto your computer. Personally, The sim are my favorite. I understand that computer games can be a negitive thing because they are addictiing, but if you don't go on for hours and hours, then I don't see what the problem is. Also, they have educational games so learning can be both fun and educational. Another thing you could do is play free games or download the game from the internet do your computer so they are both fast and easy. To @CAPS11, Computers can be both @CAPS12 and positive but I chose to look at things through a positive eye and I think you should too. After all, computers can be educational, a social networks and fun. Son @CAPS13 my positive eye... You wont be sorry.",5,5,4,4,4
1303,1,"Dear Local Newspaper On the subject of computers; Their pros and cons, I would have to say that both sides provide veru important reasons why you should and shouldn't use computers, I think that computers are very important to many students just like me. First of all computers help me and my fellow classmates with many asisgnmenrs. Some of us simply don't have the time to go to a library and look for a book that might nit even posses the information needed. On the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more! It also helps to develop your hand-eye coordination some peopel say ""you can learn hand-eye coordiantion outside too? Although that is true, typing is very fats and neat. As you can see my hand wriitng is not the best but I type very fast and make little mistakes so I do not need the neatest hand writing ever.The way I see it computers are the fastert way of doing alot of things. So if you spend time writign neatly you might nit even be able to go outside and see nature. my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers. Sometime the easy way isn;'t always the best way thats why we must have balance. Do not infrom people to stop using computers but to balance thier time with them. Everything is good if it's balanced. for example, coffiene, In large amounts it is rather unhealthy but when you need a small you turn to caffiene and it helpd, same with computers. Besides, computers are now made everwhere, trying to get rid of them is simply unreasonable. We are already in a recession we dont need more trouble. I prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative. So you see comuters are evry helpful to some balance is the answer!",3,3,4,4,4

Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make @ORGANIZATION1 easier for kids. For example, @CAPS1 helps you with essays and reports. With her program teachers wouldn't hurt their eyes trying to read sloppy hand written compositions from students @ORGANIZATION2 helps you organize and calculate, @ORGANIZATION3 gives you the @ORGANIZATION3 to create dynamic presentations. Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their @ORGANIZATION1 tasks. @ORGANIZATION1 has also aquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take test. That saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees! Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. You can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere.

I have notices many teens play cool games on the net. They seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. It in an ideal way to relax after a stressful way getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. Some websites after downloadable songs for free so you don't need to worry about the financial part. Moreover you can watch movies online anytime, form wide section such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy or even children films. No more movie tickets, no more driving in the theater. Without a doubt computers can put a single on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. Many people feel that computers both kids and adults always from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world.

How much easier could it get? computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer. Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularizeas.

1305,1,"Dear @CAPS1: A @CAPS2. Can you believe that this tiny piece of technology is influencing our everyday life? The question upon many people is, do computers give a possitive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, although computers help with certain everyday life, I think that it gives one negative effects. I have many reasons for this belief, but the three most important are going to be stated. First of all, people are to busy on their computers that they spend less time. People are also in busy with there computers that they spend less and less time enjoying nature. Last but most importantly, people are so caught up with technology, they barely spend time with freinds and family. So, in my opinion, I think people should get technology, and the real world. Have you ever walked down the street and saw someone the size of a boulder? well it isn't a good sight is it? My point is, that can happen to you let me change that to everyone in the world. Nowadays, people are spending less and less time exercising, but instead sitting at home on the computer, or slouched on the couch with a laptop. People are ignoring their health and instead staying on the computer. I for one, know how hard it is to resist playing the computer, but you shouldn't let a tiny @CAPS2 take over your mind and now your future. Nature. The most wonderful thing in the world I say the second most wonderful to technology. Have you ever turned on the t.v. and see nature its beauty? Well you can thank and global warming for that. When people use computers they burning fuel which harms our environment. People are technology they don't care about their and surroundings. If I was a I would say, ""@CAPS3 less computers and @CAPS3 more green!"" @CAPS4..... it's luxury of having a family. Family and friends , it's most important thing. Sue to computers, many people are family and friends. For example: @CAPS5: @CAPS6 want to go ride bikes? John: @CAPS7. I want to play my computer. Kids and adults was single-handed. In my opnion family most important, unlike a piece of metal that has a screen In conclusion, I think that computers of a regular effect on people, life you people by it. People are spending less time with their health and exercising advance in technology. They are all spending less time at the park big or simply just enjoying nature's beauty. Most importantly, there is less interacting with friends and family. But, this is just my opinion, it won't mean anything if you don't agree. I consideration.",4,4,4,4,4

Also they @MONTH1 end up getting in trouble in school or at home. If you spend all of your time on the computer doing whatever your doing you won't have time to go out and exercise. Not only will it be in appeling but it could be dangerous for your health after a while. All your time gets sucked into the computer and when your on it you feel like your not on for a long time and it ends up being like a few hours. It even happens to adults, my mom was on the computer for about an hour and she felt like it was only a few mins. When your on your computer for several hours you tend to got sucked in and not interact with anyone. I know this from experience. A few months ago I spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours. This effected my life a lot, I stopped going out on weekends with my friends, I always wanted to stay home when my family wont out. Then my mom confronted me about it and I realized all of my time on the computer wasn't good. I was missing out on a lot of things. Kids @MONTH1 also get at home or at school if they are on the computer for a long time they @MONTH1 not @CAPS1 their homework and end up failing a class and then stay back.

They @MONTH1 also get in trouble at home because they dont @CAPS1 their chores because their busy on the computer and neither the child or the children like getting in fights with one another. Now I know in a way it's good to have computers and be able to use them so we can look up information and its nice to sometimes talk to people on the computer for a little while but being on the computer for a little while but being on the computer for to long of an amount ran really mess you and your social life up. So all im trying to prove is that computers are an amazing invention but we should just use them a little less and get out and excersise, and have fun with our family and friend and @CAPS1 good in school and at home so we @CAPS1 get to spend some time on the computer.

My argument is that some people think that Computers are taking to much of people time, I will tell you how technology keeps people from excersizeing and gaining life expieriences.

And especially with the amount of kids palying video games or playing on the computer, the childhood obeasity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting excersize or they will just get very weak. That is why computers have a negative affect on people by not letting them get the excersize they need. My seconed reason for saying computers have a negative affect on people is that they won't be able to gain life experience I say this because when something asks you ""@CAPS3, what did you do today?"" youre only answer could be ""@CAPS4, can we chande the question to what did I not do today?"" @CAPS5 when your on the computer all day you wont be able to explore and obseve nature well maybe you could do that on a @CAPS6 server but it isnt the same. And even when parent ask if you want to go for a walk you should do it, You could learn somthing or see somthing you wouldn't be able to see on a daily basis.

Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research.

Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children.

If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours!

Don't you think socializing, and learning are two very important aspects of everyday people? Learning new things can only be interesting if you can actually see them. Books can be helpful defending on when it was made. Internet websites can gives you pictures uploads almost every week. Therefore you know where you want to book your next visit. Yes books can give you tons of information, but not as much as the thousands of websites there are out there right this minute.

Throughout everything you do in a day chatting with friends is a good way to relax and have fun. Whether it's a close friend or a co-worker. There are now several ways to talk to friends, phones, texting, instant messaging, and even video chat! Yes it @MONTH1 cause time away from family, but you can easily say goodbye to the friend and talk to them later. Finally learning is a huge deal with people today. Well with this, advanced technology we have found ways to educate students in a fun way. Websites that are colorful and fun can teach kids how to multiply and read.

1322,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, ""@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends.",3,3,3,3,3
1332,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. Computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons. One computers let you surf online anytime you want. Two, computers allow people talk online. First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. This is very convenient. What if you live far away from the nearest library? When you have to write a research paper? Jane lives @NUM1 miles away from her town library. Her mother could drive her ther, but what if she wasn't at home or driving someone else to a doctor's appointment? This is when computers come in handy. Jane can just simply go online and do the research! Not only that but also, ""www.internetsocool.gov"" states that information you can find in a regular library is about @NUM2 of information you can find online. Secondly, computers let you talk with people both faraway and nearby online and videochat. This is very useful for me. Since I live by myself in @LOCATION1, I miss my family a lot. Although with internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want! Also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" also states in his book that over @NUM3 million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes. In conclusion, ivideochat @MONTH1 sound like something to do for lark, but it is actually used for many good purposes. On the other hand, some people say that computers are bad. Some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family. Although, ""The @DATE1 survey of what people do,"" states that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally. Just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family. In conclusion in our culture because are very crucial in our culture because it can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live faraway.",5,4,5,5,5

1356,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a vey unique and advanced device. They give entetainment, pleasure, and knowledge for some people. I do not agree with the fact that computers are a good part of society. Although you do need computers. There are some reasons to which I am saying this. Typing s faster than hand writing and its neater. With all the different websites, you can advertise and buy important thing bat the internet and talk to people froma round the world. With all of these good reasons there should be an instant choice of it they're good or bad. But there is a main reason. It's areason that tells it is bad. Computers are for people. People had can't get off their write a hand written report or drive to the store to buy something. Not it. If computers never exiled, the world would no doubt be better all around place. There a lot of reason in which computers are bad. They hold information which can be hacked and by somebody thay you don't want to know something. Cyber bullying is a bad thing about computer. Another big is those stupid online games. People get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese. So as I said before, part of society and should be. This would be of good importance to me if you took my letter into. Remember that computers can take advantage of your life and make you into you're not. make that descision I hope that you live a full life and enjoy reading my letter. P.S. Try not to get involved with any online games being in a nationwide disease. ",4,3,3,3,3
1365,1,"Dear Newspaper, I think that when kids or even adults get computers, then they would not use it for good causes. When people get computers they spend more time inside and on them. They need to get outside get some exercise. Even little things like, if your going to your friends house, then take a jog there instead of your bike. When people spend more time on their computers than talking to your freinds, then they will be low on socializing and, after awile won't know how to communicate with people. All they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise. Computers could also be used for good things. If you have a project for school and need to type it up on the computer or find pictures on the internet then the computer would be a good resource. If you have a job for working with computers or fixing computers, then you would spend a lot of time on your computer. It also lets you interact with people on the othe side of the world. You can also learn about interesting facts or places. Computers could also be used for bad reasons. When people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got. This can lead them into getting obese. They can also use it for sexual harrasment for stalking people. People can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or illegal things. So as you can see computers aren't safe in a lot of ways. I hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them. Thank you and have a good day.",4,4,4,4,4
1373,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers are benefitial to society even though some people don't because they give us a means of communication, computers give us the ability to learn about forein people or places, and computers help businesses in so many ways. Computers are a most have in a society. Computers give us a means of communication such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6-mail, and so much more. Without the computer, families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button. @CAPS5 lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night. Long distance calls cost money and it is not worth @MONEY1 a call if you call every couple of days. Communication has evolved so much in the past @NUM1 years. Computers are just the bigginning. That is why computers are benefitial to communication. Computers give us the ability to look up facts about forein places and people in a matter of minutes. We could look up who was the @CAPS7 of @LOCATION1 in the would get multiple sites on the @CAPS7. Computers help us expand our learning capabilities and give us a chance to learn things that normally we wouldn't. That is another reason why computers are very benefitial to the society. The last reason that supports the fact the computers are benefitial to the society is because computers help keep much of data. Work data and they help @PERCENT1 of businesses we file reports communicate with other branches of that company. I learned in class that in the job were much more difficult than they are today because of technology. Some people think that using computers deprives people of going out and exercising.

1391,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I understand you think computers don’t have an effect on people. Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. It also helps you with your work. Never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decition that you want to make.",4,4,3,4,4

Sure they might be on @NUM1 hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school, meals and activities. Some people need computers for their @CAPS1. News @CAPS2 companies need computers for editing and printing out the papaer. They also put the news on there website. What would most people do without a computer? Computers are positive because of the new technology! The new technology is helping people interact over the. if you have a long distance friend or family member, there are how many ways to talk to them. You could use @CAPS3, skype, oovoo, @CAPS4 or even email. When I go on the computer I dont just sit and watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or @CAPS7 online. I interact with my friends @PERCENT1 of us population between the ages @NUM3 have a @CAPS3. @PERCENT2 have skype or oovoo and talk to people that are too far away to visit.

1393,1,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better.

You also @MONTH1 think that they are not getting enough exercise.Well you are right but I am going to explain way your wrong. You can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. The first thing you could do is learn. While you are on the internet you can go to learning websites. Some of thoes websites can teach you about faraway places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 for example, you could learn their culture and the @CAPS5 they celebrate and why. Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. Another thing you could do so the computer is socialize. You might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends. Well you can. There are websites like @CAPS6 and facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now you can webcam people. When you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam. Lastly you could go into chatrooms like @CAPS7 ( aol instant message ) and talk to people while you are on that sight. The last thing you can do is become more healthy. Is it not surprising? yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com car give you a might eating schedual right for your . After that website you could go out and get the you will need. Another thing that the computer offers is hand-eye coordination. While you are looking at the screen your had is controling the "" mouse"" while the, mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. Lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world.

1414,1,"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in would floor.

You can go on sites that you on your @CAPS4. Show you how your body works for @CAPS5, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are not boring. This a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didnt. The time is now!

1415,1,"Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. They aren’t communicating with any of their friends, and aren’t really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps. This would happen @CAPS5 we banned computers! Computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. My close friend @PERSON1 told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, and doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didn’t have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. This statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. Also a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didnt have computers, half of the world’s discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well. Children’s specialist @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports.” @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. Clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. Lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate everyday. We wouldn’t want to deny them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didn’t have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4 a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5 says that when people don’t have computers & can’t communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they don’t talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this.

But people rarely do that, parent's and kid's stay on the computer not caring about nothing else but the screen the kid's stay up all night knowing they have school they dont even do their homework. I have proof my freind's, research show's, my mother also agree's. I suggest that you will agree on my opinion'. @PERCENT1 of my freind's agree with me because they have been through this, and they would'nt wake up to go to school. Dr @PERSON1's of @ORGANIZATION1 researched how parent's hardly spend time with their family. For example father's they basically always on the computer either working or looking up stuff. My mom say's that when she was younger she loved the internent. She never wanted to get off: @CAPS1 i hope youv enjoyed my opinion', thank's for even taking this time to read it.

We also don't have to go to the library any were to do research because we have a whole library of information at our house (the computer) another thing is that people are now able to communicate all over the world which will allow us to learn about other staight from the source.

I also think that computers affect people in the way that they don't spend lot of time with their family. The effects that computers have on people is that some people can't stop using them even if they want. People become very adictive to computers because they spend almost all their time in there. People don't exercise no more because they spend all their time on the computer, shoping things that they don't need they just buy them because they like them. The effects that computers have on people are that some people just to be talking to their friend on myspace. His facebook and other websites that are not good for them. I think that the effects that computers have on people are that they take away people's time because some people spend lot of time on the computers, living their family's alone without spending time with them. Computers take away peoples time because they don't spend time exercising or playing out side with friends or brothers or go to a park to spend same time with their family or have a contact with family and invite some friends to come over to have some good time instead of being in the computer all day without doing nothing. Computer's take away time or love for your family and they make you spend the time that you don't have. The effect's that computers have on people are bad because people can't stop using them even if the wanted to because they are all ready adictive to them. People can't stop using them because in the computers you could do lot's of things like shoping talk to friends and visit websites that have very interesting things from other countries that are very beutiful but some people can't stop using them because they go to play games or because they are down loding music from websites that they don't have to. In conclusion i think that the effects that computers have on people are very bad because some people spend lot of time on them and they even spend the time that they don't have and the time they need.

1440,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. First, computers are a great source to do school work on. Computers let you learn more information. In addition, computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society. My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with. An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assainnment to do that had to be typed. Its impossible to type an essay without a computer. Further more, if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and their is no time in your day to go to a library, the computer is a great source. Now doesn't that make sense? Computers don't just help you with homework, but many people go to college online also. My parents don't have enough money to afford me to go to college, ""says @NUM1-year old @PERSON1,"" so I take free course online and they work great! ""@CAPS1 it obvious that computers have a good effect on people? In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great place to look when you need information. For example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area. The computer is an great place to look at updated pictures, and learn about your new hometown. Sixty-nine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home. People @MONTH1 also want to learn basic information about bears or bees is my belief that the computer is a great source to do learn infromation obviously, computers have a great effect on people and it benefit society. Lastly, computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends. ""I have my whole mom's side of the family living in @LOCATION1. When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them. I feel closer and part to keep in touch with them. i feel closer and part of one big happy family,"" @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2, says. People who have family living in other states, countries and even other countries, don't get to see eachother every day of the year @CAPS2 is why computers can help, the people keep in touch. Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days, weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them of ten. A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging. Therefore, i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society. to sum it all up, computers benefits society and have possitive effects on people. Computers are great sources to do school work, they give you information your looking for, and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends. Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and possitive effect on people and benefit the society. Thank you!",5,5,4,4,4

1446,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect. ",4,5,4,4,4

Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and it teaches people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world throughout everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the @LOCATION1 has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school I know that from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study in a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer know that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen.

Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy to use it. That's ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, than nothing does. As I have shown, computers deffinitly do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people.

They allow us to talk with people all over the world. They give us the ability to learn about things. Lastly, they save us money. Aren't these all things benefit us? I think so. Please keep reading to hear more about why computers are good. First off, computers give us the ability to talk with people all over the world. A lot of my family lives in different @CAPS1, and thats how I talk to them is through the computer. If you move away from all your friends and family, wouldn't you want to still keep intouch with them? Well you could by chatting with them on the computer. To keep the ball rolling, computers give us the oppirtunity to learn about different things. If I go on ""@CAPS2.com"", I could type in anything I want, and get information about it. Or I get an answer to a question. Are you a parent that wants to know how their child is doing in school? You could go to their school website and check their grades in each class they have. To wrap it all up, computers save us money everyday. If you needed to look up information for a project without a computer, you would have to drive all the way to the library and buy a book. But with a computer, you could get information easy in the convienience of your own home. In conclusion, you could see that computers benefit us in many ways. Thay give us the ability to talk to friends and family all around the world. They give us the oppirtunity to look up information quick and easy. Lastly, they save us money everyday.

1456,1,"How would you like to got a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after-school? What if you were bored to death, and you couldn't watch t.v. or play games? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer: you can watch videos and play games, you can chat and talk to people, and you can even boost up your grade. I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @CAPS2, let's look at how a computer can change your life. Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. You are going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser. I remember @TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1 and @DATE1 I found out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we talked about how that @CAPS7 posibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school. For example, how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can do. If you got bad grades (without computer), you will go to a bad college and have a bad job, however, if you got good grades(with computer), you will go to a good college and get a good job. Next, let's look at how you can chat or talk to people. You can have a mesaging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers. You can also communicate with people who has an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them. So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public. Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together. A computer can really the of your life. Lastly, let's look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored. Why you go youtube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting? ""@CAPS10, I was done with homework and I didnt know what to do, so i online and spend only watching youtube videos, sometimes people like playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing tetris, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight's before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, can entertain you as well. As you can see, saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely non-sense.

Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will be the down fall or support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand-eye coordination. Since the time children are in grade school, they learn typing on a keyboard. Special programs help kids learn the necesary skill while enjoying the practice. When I was small, a mere fight years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to barnes and noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed ""type to learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons as well as teaching children to type is general, teaches hand-eye coordination in high school, college, and the job world. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resemes, and applications. In this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand-eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, bejewled or car racing teach the skill and much more advanced games for example, world of war craft need perfect coordination can be through typing and games, both on the computer.

Another reason is if you have family that does not live with you and you can't go an see them then you can chat with them. Another rwson is that of your going somewhere and you don't know the weather for the next day then you can go online and find out what's the weather for that day.

1480,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",4,4,4,4,4

Computers are way important in our world because we can monitor natrual @CAPS1 such as tornados, hurricancs, and earthquakes without this technology over @PERCENT2 more people will die from these @CAPS1 without computers because the will less or no warning about the situation.

However some people should limit themselves on things like facebook and twitter, some people spend too much time on those things and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes a day on those sites. One of the reasons I think computers are good is because some students might not now the answer to something on their homework and could use the computer to find out the answers. Another reason why computer can be very valueable to all students is because lets say a student has a quiz on mitusis and cells in science the next day and doesnt really understand it they could use the computer to learn about it and do good on their quiz. Another reason that computer are good for people is because it helps them communicate with theri friends. Some kids are only and arent that gool at interacting with people in person. But these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends. however like I said earlier some poepleget carried away and spend too much time doing this kind of stoffs and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes per day on these social networking sites. Some people use their computers for other important things like buying things and getting directions and adresses. If somebody want to go to a store in a different town but didnt know where it was they could up the address an dthen find the directions to that place some people also use the computer to purchase things like groceriess and clothes.

1509,1,"Hi my name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing to the local news paper to say that computers are good for people and helps alot like how to get one place two another, how to learn about black history or famous people that did something to the world, and how to find out the news and weather from home or at work, how to keep your besnness going without computers their jobs would be hopless, and like of your family or you tyring to make it in life and the only way to get in contact would be the computers there are computers every where even doctors use them at a hospital to keep people alive to see what wrong with them and where they came from, and one more jobs need computers to, to see if the person is capable for the job so they might look for background information with out it even you would not have a good job so hee are some resons why computers are important. One of them is we need computers for so that we can get around, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers. There lots of more stuff that coulf have said that prove computers are good and why we need them but i just had to cut it short and schools need computers the most to take test on the computers of they have to, so thats all the resons why we need computer and why they are good bye.",4,3,4,4,4
1516,1,"Dear local news, @CAPS2 more and more people use computers people ask if computers actually benifit society. In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, acess to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society here in why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite @CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like @CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the @CAPS1 were @CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather. Instead or local news imidiatly acess it on you @CAPS4 you can acess encyclopedia and distionarys like at the websites @CAPS5 provide an easy imidiats fools for daily uses. One least example towards the of computers Their are many websites that you can. One of @CAPS5 websites is called , @CAPS6 lets you upload picture of pople or family events for people in you @MONTH1 video chat with people over a and see the other persons face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like @CAPS6 it is actually adding time. In conclution, @CAPS5 reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society, They provide entertainment, easy acess to and have many websites for social interactions, @CAPS7 society would be alot harder and this is why I think computers benifit society.

I like computers but @CAPS1 not obsess with computers give good efforts on people, even me you can learn things off the computer and you start to get good hand eye coordination one of the things I like about the is that you can 'talk"" to other people. Lots of people uses the computer a little too much that they dont exercise, or watch nature as much some normal (other) people should, and they dont spend them with their familys. I rather spend time on the computer for only (#@NUM1) three hours so then I can do other things with my time and you or anybody should do the same.",1,1,1,1,1
1537,1,"My opinion on computers is that I think it's a good idea for people to go on computers. I think this way because if you haven't seen someone for so many years then you got a chance to see that person or talk to that person through the computer. Computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do. I like to go on the computer to talk to my friends that I haven't seen a while you could also meet new people and make friends. If there wasn't computers then we would have to look through a lot of books for information, or go all the way to the bank to check your account balance, this is why I think computers are good ideas. On the computer you could see workouts to get fit we don't only have to go to the gym. My dad gose on the computer to talk to his sisters, or play games with other people arount the world. Another example I could use is my mom she talks to her family in @LOCATION1 and in other places too. If there wasn't computer's we couldn't our tests, we couldn't get information. I think computers are very good ideas, cause it's good when you got to pay your bills too. We could interact with friend and familys online too thats what a lot of tenns and aults do if there was a rainyday or if its snowing and we don't go the chance to see our friends or relitives. For some people they think it's not a good idea because some people get addicted to the computers, but there is so much that you could do that the computer won't get you board. Thats why I think that computers are a good idea and that they are very important.",3,3,3,3,3
1550,1,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business.

1553,1,"Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!",5,4,5,5,5
1554,1,"Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to.",4,3,4,3,3

Firstly, the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports. They help children's reports because for example they are doing a report on ""@CAPS2 lincon"" they have access to look up the peron to get information they need right at home. Doing reports with their computer there is no need to use up your projects you can also look up information and print out pichers to make your project more vibrant and eye-catching to younger people. Also @CAPS3 allows you to type your information to make @CAPS3 look orginzed and neet. Accordly, if you are trying to find some job applications without wasting your time, just look on the internets.

You are able to look up the paying of the job and regulations, and you can find out if you get the job fastered. Lastly, @CAPS3 allows socializing. For example like facebook or/and myspace lets you talk to friends from school or friends you met online. For adult who don't have a myspace or facebook account they can use email, msn, aol, aim/aol instant messager, or via chat. This way adults can catch up on work and children can kee in touch with friends or/and family.

Another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things. The last reason is because you can do things in seconds on a computer that would normaly take hours. Hand-eye coordination is an importand thing: for example you're walking down the street when a baseball flys at you, your able to cach it because of all the time you have bin on the computer has taught you hand-eye coordination.

1590,1,"Dear Local @CAPS1: I'm sitting at the couch thinking about what I should do for vacation. I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to do same creative writing, but my notebooks are all scattered, I don't know how to quickly contact someone who could help and I have no idea about the country that I plan to visit. I take a last look at my notebooks strewn about the closet looking very much like a tornado swept through and I find solution on the highest shelf my laptop. First, I highly agree with the people who think computers are useful. Three effects they have on people who use them usely are fantastic. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop @MONTH1 be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances a part, so they use e'mail and @ORGANIZATION1. They travel places with people at their fingertips. However a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people. Their schedule could be chaotic. Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective. Take my story for example. My mom hates wasting, so instead of me driving to a friend we @CAPS2. Saves money and time! In addition, I happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks. I've written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling all over my room. What organizational tool could help me in this situation? Why a laptop of course! One laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze. Anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer! What you a room notebooks that you buy of, or a single, computer with tons of space and back up? You tell me. Computers encourage users to be more organized! Respectively, computers are resource for a millions of pages information. They're similar to libraries. But think about a library and then imagine a computer. One you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some @MONTH1 argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org' and'.gov' and even'.edu'. These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research. By using computers I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial. They have effectively made me more intellgent as a person. In conclusion, it's my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects, and these include money/gas-saving conversations through @CAPS2 and email organization and increased intelligence from reading.

I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot.

Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas. Well how in computers help with with hand-eye coordination yoe ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand-eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dont they need as meen of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand-eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects.",5,5,4,5,5
1598,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1 over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1 about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on an computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook. There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped. In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus. The next day @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as mcafee. and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cought by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend more then @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for @PERSON3's @CAPS7! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About @PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible.",4,4,4,5,4
1600,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you really think we should'nt have computers or @CAPS2 you think we shouldn't? Well I say we should because computers has everything you need as in info, games, school, websites where you can by clothes. Others say no for some reason why they say it's not good for you and to addictive I clearly think that it is appropriate. Having computers, it absolutely helps us learn, whatever you needed to learn a computer has it. If you wanted learn about other places besides the one you live in you could find it on the computer. I remember one time when I was looking for a word in the dictionary and they didn't have it and I looked it up on the computer and they had it I thought it was magnificent. I love computers it connect's me with my family that are in far away places there's nothing better than that because you could talk to your family all day or wherever you want. Computers have everything, any info you need get it off of the computer. It let's you stay alert on what's happening today in the world. It really does work on your hand and eye coordination. ""@CAPS3't that brilliant?"" Some say computers are not good because people are not enjoying nature. Or people start to not to want to get out of the house, you don't spend time with your family, because your so addictive to it. Some say your not exercising or nothing so you get too fat, or too skinny and your not healthy at all. But i disagree, that's why i @CAPS2 not like righting this side of the story.""@CAPS4 kidding."" @CAPS5 you have a chance because computers are the best they are definitely not the baddest but after reading this you could'nt agree with me more so it's @CAPS5 to agree or never to disagree. The big question is what will you choose! This is not a hard decision to make.",3,3,3,3,3
1602,1,"Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to eachother. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along. His buisiness transfered @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh-air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vaction. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vaction because they don't know about the country or place.",5,5,4,5,5

Some reasons I think this is that we get a lot of knowledge from it, contact people you don’t live near and haven't seen in a while.

They help people find lost fmaily members, and they help police officers find many criminals.

1617,1,"Dear local newspaper, I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far away places: and people have educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First of all computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. When I was in sixth grade I had to do a project on @ORGANIZATION1 didn't know anything about him. But, luckily we have computers so I was able to @ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wodd or information on him and got an a plus on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade I had to do a project on @LOCATION1. I went on a computer went on @CAPS1.com a get lots of imformation and got on a plus. The second reason computers are benefitial to the society is because computers have educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 saids, ""@CAPS2 percent of the computers websites are educational. I also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on @CAPS3. com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time.

I asked my class and ninety percent of them go on myspace.com. On the other hand the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. Theres a website called @NUM1.com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven. Now, you know my reasons, why computers are good to the society, they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, have educational websites, and even allow people to tlak to other people online.

Like I said in my first paragraph, everywhere you go you see somebody wired into an electronic device. People no longer go outside and play cowboys and @CAPS7 because now all they have to do is hit paly.

This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notedly become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net. The cure? Traveling, or even talking walks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of their world in which they live. They have to make important descions for themselves, their children, even their country, and staring at a computer screen wont help at all. It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication.

For children who are old enough to use / work a computer, they'@CAPS1 be inside on that nice day. There are many nice things to do on a computer, like chatting with friends, checking your e-mails, and facebook. Even though these things are pleasurable, you should limit your time on the computer. Most @ORGANIZATION1 the time that you spend on the computer could be spent outside or at the movies. Not being on the computer could help small buisnesses too. If you pay money to do an activity, or buy something, watch something it would make a difference in the small buisness's profits. On the other hand, computers don't benefit your health. Mac. magazine says that there are health risks when you use your computer all the time. @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people become obese and have vitamind @CAPS1 deficiancy from using their computers so much. When using your computer you could be working out or exercising, and this causes obesity. Also, if you are inside all the time, you wont get the healthy amount @ORGANIZATION1 sunlight that you need, thus you have a vitamin @CAPS1 deficiancy. Another health risk is having bad eyes. If you spend hours a day on a computer your eyes can get permanently damaged. Do you want your child / children to be put at risk for using a computer too much? In conclusion, it is safe to say, that computers do not benefit society today. Many people have an addiction to technology, you could be using your time more wisely, and computers put your health at risk. Although computers do allow us to have an easier time accomplishing tasks, abusing the privlage will have consiquenses on everyone.",5,5,5,4,4
1666,1,"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I have recently heard about many arguments based on computers ruining society. I strongly disagree with this. I think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends. The internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Some people have moved away and I haven't been able to talk to then. Now, with the internet I can able to talk again. The same case with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she ever talked to. Now, with facebook she has re united with them. This also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail, which costs money, unlike email. So the internet can also be a way of saving money. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter. The internet is a great way to keep intouch with friends and relatives. I also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book. If you don't have enough time to go the to a library, you can do some research at your house. What if the library is closed if you do go, then you wasted some time. The internet never closes, it is open @NUM1. What if you go to the library and they are open, but do hot have a book on your subject? This can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet. If you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet. The internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing about every game, there is that you would feel like playing. Also @CAPS1 of spending about @MONEY1 on an x-box and a game, you @MONTH1 only have to spend about @MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer. There are also many websites that have games on them. Some websites are for specific games, and same have many games on them. Only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends. On the other hand, many games are only for one player. As a result, a computer is a great use to play games. In conclusion, I believe the computer is great need for our society. In the long run it will pay off, especially with the economics problems our country is having now, by helping us save money,. It will also allow connection with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like.",5,5,5,5,5
1675,1,"One evening, @CAPS1 I got home from school, I didn't know what I had for homework. I decided to call my friends cell phone, but instead I got her voicemail. I left her a voicemail and called her house phone instead, the same thing bad happened. Luckily, I had my other friends numbers I could use. The next day, I asked her why she didn't pick her cell and house phone. She told me ""I'm sorry, I guess I was to busy on the computer e-mailing other people."" @CAPS1 I think of people being on the computer too much, I think they don't get enought exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. First @CAPS1 people spend too much time on the computer, they spend less time excersising. About @PERCENT1 of people do this and it's not healthy. @CAPS2 people do this too often, then they will not get enough excercise and without excersise then they won't be healthy @CAPS1 they get older. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2 adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @NUM1 hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @CAPS2 adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's to early for kids to be unhealthy."" I also agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1, she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don't care about nature, @CAPS1 people do this, I can't stand it. Its like they don't care about anything else. What I don't get is why can't they go outside and do something for at least a half hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. You could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand @CAPS2 its a bad day like @CAPS2 its snowing or a thunderstorm and you can't do anything outside, then you go on the computer. I think that at least @PERCENT2 of people would try this. Third, @CAPS2 people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hung out with friends or family. @CAPS2 your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. But you can't because your on the computer, she would be furious at you. You picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There's probably a @PERCENT1 chance she won't ever talk to ou again. and I don't blame her. People who spend to much time on the computer, would barely understand whats going on. @CAPS2 someone tells you something, it goes in one ear and out the other. @CAPS1 people do this, its really dissappointing because you dont hang out as much as with your friends and family. As you can see, people are spending too much time on the computer than excersing, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. @CAPS2 you ask me, I don't play on the computer as much which is a good thing.",5,5,5,5,5
1684,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extreamly bad for you, and we need to take percaution, and worry about eye protection vertual harrasment, and that there are dangerouse people on the @CAPS2. Eye protection is important. Although computers are hurting them by, the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes. Also if you look for too long it could make them tierd. I can tell you from personal experence that glasses are un-cool and some people get picked on for it and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you can see as well as you did befor. It's glasses or even going blind. Vertual harrasment is another thing to be aware of. Over the @CAPS2 you could be cyber bullyed by kids you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not know. For example, one day you could be on @CAPS3 and be talking on a chat room and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or even just plain remakes. Witch brings me to the, sexual harrasment. Sexual harrasment if extreamly can make people feel usually bad selfs. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding there rase, there gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra percaution when seeing sexual harrasment. Sexual preditors are a parents biggest fear to kids. Sexual preditors are everyware, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS3, or even your neibors and wile kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do there extreamly un-safe. This is why you @CAPS7 put any personal information on the @CAPS2 not your adress, not your birthday, not your cell or house numbers, nothing not even your town. Also sometimes its a little dangerous to put your last name. So be very carful on the intrenet. When you see sexual harrasment, or someone being followed by a sexual preditor report them! and be safe.",3,3,3,3,3
1704,1,"Dear local newspaper, I support the advances in technology, and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I think this for @NUM1 simple reasons, @CAPS1, you gain computer skills, which can help in other situations. Second: Computers give people the chance to learn about faraway people and places.Lastly when you have a computer you can chat and talk to other people. When I think of a computer, I think of typing or a keyboard. After a few times of using a computer you get @CAPS2 and better it. You gain, typing skills, hand eye coordination and mouse skills. After jusst a few uses, your computer skills build up and you soon get good at it. When you do get @CAPS2 though, you get better quicker and more so it all works out very well. When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search anything and everything. Weather it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is helpful. When I am doing my homework, and I don't know how to another a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get help with any homework I need help in, its great.I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but theres no one to talk to? Well that problem can be solved very simply, get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone half way around the world. Its amazing you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. A computers chat you to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. Computers are great. When your on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it. They are helpful and fun you never run out of options with a computer at your side. In my opinion, there is so much to gain and learn from a computer.",4,5,4,4,4
1707,1,"Dear whom it @CAPS1, Have you ever wondered what it be like to spend all your time in front of computers? Well, if you are, I believe that should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom says only an hour aa day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and (or) play over a friends house. Yes, playing on computer is fun, but you have to execise to. (you know) @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors. Like that's how I met trees, animals, beautiful senery. You could feel like you were having the time or your. The last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use. you could make snowmen in the winter or if it's raining you could watch a movie. you could build a lot. In conclusion building, playing and jumping (the list could go on) You can enjoy the outdoors. Just rember the three good reason why are you could use the wonderful and lovly outdoors.

1710,1,"Wouldn't you agree that computers have a great affect on people. The three reason why they have a good affect on people is because, it gives you good typing skills, its educational, and it helps you out with alot of things. The first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills. If you have a computer you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good. Each time you use the computer your hands ajust to the keys on the computer. Say if there is someone that wants to work with computers when they get older, well if they practice their typing on their computers at home they will be eligible for the job working with computers. Also computers could be good for the hearing impared. If the hearing impared use to the computers then they can get a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 and chat with people online. This would be useful to them because since they could not hear what people say they can read what people say through the internet. Another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational. In my opinion, computers are very educational because there are alot of websites that teach you facts about different places. For example, what food people eat in different countrys, or where that country is. A website that is the best for finding out accurate facts is www.Ask.com. Ask.com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds. Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites. The last reason why computers have a affect on people is because they help you with alot of things. They help you with alot of things because if you want to know how far @LOCATION2 is from @LOCATION1 then you can go on your pc and find out, or say that you lost the directions to your friends house and your on your way to their house if you brought your labtop you can go on the labtap and find where her house is from your labtop. I know your probably thinking there is such thing as a gps, well if you think about it gps's can be confusing, but your computer reads it out to you. Know your probably saying in your heads why don't you text/call @CAPS3/@CAPS4 if you think about it what if your friend does not talk clearly. In conclusion, wouldn't you agree that computers do have good effects on people. My three arguments are, they help your typing skill educational. They help you with things. please take my ideas into consideration.",4,5,5,5,5
1712,1,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 say that people are spending too much time foucusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are @CAPS1! Computers are a giant step into new technology. For example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online and give children some down time where they can learn about far away places and people. If you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly relized that you forgot one of the most important books! You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. Computers then come in handy. You can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson. Children @CAPS2 to commonicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends children would be knowhere. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, childeren can do reaserch, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about far away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now availble. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers @CAPS3 would not know the important news when @CAPS3 needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future (yes I am repertative) @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future.

Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town are very good for society. There are the major benefits of using a computer. @CAPS3 is the fact you can use microsoft to write up a paper. Sixth grader @PERSON6 says, ""I would rather type than write a paper. Another reason to use a computer is a for research."" @CAPS4 many articles and facts are online about anything you need,"" says @PERSON4. The final benefit of a computer is the fact you can know about world news in a flash. ""I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage,"" says @PERSON5.

Stuff like @CAPS5 use a texting form on a computer which helps us connect without making a huge phone bill: with instant messanger I can talk to @CAPS2 girlfriends,"" says @PERSON2. Also, there is facebook which can help us connect on a global stage. ""I can talk with @CAPS2 cousin in @LOCATION2,"" says @CAPS6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. @CAPS3, we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. ""I can use @CAPS2 computer anywhere I like,"" says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eigth grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" The final major advance is the use of the printer,"" I use @CAPS2 printer to print of papers to bring to school,"" @PERSON3 said. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. There is many benefits to owning a computer. We talk to people world-wide when ever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology. @CAPS4 please help defend us kids in this case about computer use.",5,4,5,5,5

Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Also excersise is a big issue now and you aren't getting any by at a computer. On the other hand though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public. Also these w ebsites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it.

It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day but not using to the internet. Websites can be a way to find computer time. Edline is homework or an assignment. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive.

In my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item. I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, they allow people to stay in contact with people they dont see very often, and they allow people to keep up and know whats going on in modern life. One reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they don't see very often. Today, parents don't mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1. This feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today. People in @LOCATION1 can talk with people in @LOCATION2. This type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they've discovered. Another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life. Many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. Some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. With computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. There is even at home colleges now where you take your class online. I believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only. Finally the last reason I believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet. There are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things. Also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @MONTH1 know a lot about the topic. Another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic, read history about it, and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more. Overall, I believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years. I believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge, the ability to keep in touch with others, and to keep in touch with modern life. I believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies.

I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think computers @MONTH1 cost too much, but you @CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I know that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree.",4,5,4,4,4
1737,1,"I agree with the computers helping people. To start with, computers have a possitive affect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Also it allows people to talk online from far away places. So, yes, computers are good for people. First of all, computers do have a possitive affect. The computer @MONTH1 give some one motivation. Or it will help someone find their lost pet. Also it could help you get a job. Plus you can find a safe home with it. So, ya computers do have a possitive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. Also you can get information on places you will visit. This will help learn about diffrent contrays. Most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. This concluds that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for familys. Also people who have hospitilized family. Plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a possitive affect on people. They given us ability to learn! Lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away. So, in conclution, it is a benifit for people to use the computers!",3,3,3,3,3
1743,1,"Dear local newspaper, I beileve that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I beileve that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the @PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use internet know that poeple need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone dosen't want to be bothered then don't bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privleged for a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad.",5,6,5,5,5
1744,1,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life, they help with many things. Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I @CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: ""I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay orginized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without earasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get @CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you @MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are @CAPS1, ext. No more, ""I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to @CAPS1 what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a dobt, no more, ""I'm bored"". @CAPS1 you use your computer to @CAPS1 anything like this? If so you must enjoy it. People use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings. Now what side are you at?",5,4,4,4,4
1747,1,"Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don't have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can't do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can't. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect.",3,3,3,3,3
1748,1,"Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don't fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines.",4,4,4,4,4
1749,1,"Dear newspaper, I think that computers are great for researching things like for a car or sereach for people places and thing. @ORGANIZATION1 are great because you keep in touch with you family and friends. Like you can email them webcam chat and you can instant message them.I think a lot of people should get into @ORGANIZATION1 because you can do everything on them. You can save you picture, download music, play games. People say that some people spend to much time on the @ORGANIZATION1 well i think they should because they should learn new and different things about different countrys city or even states. I don't think there is noting wrong about spending time on a @ORGANIZATION1.",2,2,3,3,3
1752,1,"Computers are great technology, but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives! Computers cause children to fail and lose their exercize. The children also put their self in danger by joining a few different websites. Don’t waste your time in a boring computer screen! I am almost @PERCENT1 positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their back packs in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. My mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @CAPS1, when he would only go one @NUM1 minutes a day to talk to family members. Now, my mom created a @CAPS1, that @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was gona only go on to with the family, but @CAPS2 plays all the pointless applications, such as, ""cafe world."" @CAPS2 waste her time on @CAPS1 whenever @CAPS2 is home, when @CAPS2 could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. Something I havent mentioned is, I use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didnt go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I relized after I got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. My dad then disconected my @CAPS4, and I beleive my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconecting the @CAPS4, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @CAPS3 home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, ""blogtv.com."" were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing! Stop wasting your life people! Go out and have fun, dont let the @CAPS4 keep you home. The @CAPS4 is unsafe and pointless.",3,3,3,3,3
1758,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 on a beautiful sunny day, people inside on their computers instead of enjoying the weather. This is what could happen if people are using them. I believe that computers have a bad effect on people because their communication skills will drop, people won't get enough exercise & their health can be imnarred. As i mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis, will drop their communication skills.. People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to. For example, if i logged onto & chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number & your name. This could lead to things such as kidnaping & even rape. Also, interactions with family members & friends @MONTH1 decrease. You can be playing a computer game, online, or going on youtube to watch random videos of people. You tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children. Kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on when click the wrong one bringing them inapropiate website. Finally, teenagers and adults go onto facebook & twitter. Some @MONTH1 say these sites @MONTH1 change the social interactions, but it really isn't. Kids & adults are constantly getting addicted to it. Also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal. People don't need to know when you do things in your day i have keep up this our communication skills are sure to decrease. Secondly, exersice is a problem. Doctors say that @PERCENT1 of their parents are obeise or over weight according to @ORGANIZATION1. Kid just sit at home & play computer games such as sims @NUM1 & video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them. No one really goes for walks any more either. Also, people don't go out & enjoy nature like the you. @PERSON1, a state @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2 said, ""each year the number of people are getting fewer & fewer. Preety soon all parks are going to have to get closed down."" @CAPS2 don't want this to happen, do you? I know i would not. Our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced. Finally, more & more people are becomeing unhealthy. A person's eye sight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer everyday. My aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work. She went to her eye doctor because her vision was become weaker. One of the first questions he aske was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? she answered yes. He said she would need cataraks eye surgery. This was all in result of using a computer. Finally, you could get althritis in your hands & fingers from typing & using the mouse all the time. Many people at the age of fourty are probaly going to need hand surgeries from all the work the do, likes! As you can see technology is harming your communication skills, exersice & you health. I bet you don't want your future generations like this. So take a part & contact your local newspaper today.",4,5,4,4,4
1759,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy a lot of people's time which could be used for other matters. The internet also contains alot of unappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many petafiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in america is climbing. There is no doubt that electronics, play a huge role in this event. For example my brother plays on the computer everyday, so barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also there is alot of content. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornagraphy. most sites don't even alert you that by how you need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very little acctually ask for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children as a young teens. Its truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and. Petafiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive, to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location, and to commit rape. Some victims are enough speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet. For these reasons I say that computers have a negative effect computers lives because some positive but sadly cons outweight pros such as before mention occupation of time, content on the internet. I truly believe that the planet would be better with out computers.",5,6,4,4,4

1770,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren't even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, ""where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment.",4,5,5,4,4
1773,1,"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. ",4,5,4,4,3
1776,1,"Technology, such as computers are very big. I belive computers have a good effect on people. People that use computers mostly use it to connet with family do research, or to be neat and not write it on paper. I belive that people who don’t think computer make a good effect on people shouldn't bother wasting their time using one. @PERCENT1 of people only use computer to connect with family. Usually your family either lives far away or in another state and you dont get to see them very often. Thats why I think video chating on the computer is a good thing. Also is a family come up you could @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 your family members instead of calling them because they would talk to you forever. Lastley if you use myspace, facebook or twitter you could connect with old friends and not just family members. ""@CAPS2 my teachers enjoy it when I use the computer to do my work, they said its alot neater"" said @CAPS3 romano from strong middle school. Teachers perfer it when you use the computers to do your work. When you are writing a book report or you are writing a story, you would want to use,icrosoft word of something to write out your paper so it is easer for teachers to read. Also if your in science class and you need to make the chart you would want to use exal to make the chart or graph look more professional. Lastly is you wanted to do a presintation on bloody @DATE1 or little @CAPS4 nine you would want to use a power point instaed of just reading from note cards. If people didn't have google or yahoo they wouldn't know what to do, computers are very good for research. If a student to do a presentation on something they would want to know more about it and look,the topic up. Also if your family was having a discusion at dinner and you had no idea what they were talking about you would look it up online, lastly if you just wanted to find lyrics to a song because you and a friend disagreed on something. Once again I belive that computers make a good effect on people, good for connecting with friends and family. Good for being neat and lastly good for reaserching anything!",3,3,3,3,3
1785,1,My opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.,3,3,3,3,4
2981,2,"In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive.  Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not.  Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life.  This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.     Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries.  They find these things to be offensive.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended.  The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive.  The library is a place for study.  It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world.  It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.     I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive.  Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research.  There are certain sections in the library.  If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section.  I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section.  The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not.  If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.     Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need.  One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it.  If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it.  The library can be compared to a big computer.  One can basically find anything there.  Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs.  It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.     Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life.  If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left.  People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone.  There does not need to be any censorship in libraries.  It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find.",4,3,3,3,4
2985,2,"Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.      So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. We I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated.     The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will  always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go.      I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years.     So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer.     Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood.     The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to.     Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.      So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay",3,2,1,1,2
2990,2,"A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax.  Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there.  Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship.  Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.       First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted.  If they offend you then do not read them.  It is as simple as that.  Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs.  A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series.  @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs.  Therefore those people boycott the series.     I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released.  While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing.  Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party.  They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong.  I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book!       Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content.  For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person.  Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards.     Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true.  If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library.  Although there could be a way to compromise.  If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides.       In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children.  When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read.  While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read.  Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes.  Books are a gateway to another world.  Why take that magic away from children",6,5,6,5,5
2993,2,"Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are, and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read? I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves.     Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays. If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it.     Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man. Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action. Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face. Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her. Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living. Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting. @CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life.     Just think all that I have told you about, gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people. these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves.",2,2,2,2,2
3003,2,"The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values. With this on going problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our ablities, based off of our values",3,2,2,2,2
3010,2,"Many people believe that magazines, books, movies, music, posters, plus some other kind of bad stuff that parents don't want there @CAPS1 to see. Some of the stuff they might have in the are books about different colored people, maybe there might also have some terrible things about that colored skin hairitage, @CAPS1 that are to young to be looking at stuff that is in these books. A lot of the @CAPS2 Libraries have these things speard around all over the store.     Some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color. If they don't like what the book and what it has to say then don't get that book. Because you can't change the way the author wrote the story, music, movie, poster. But most the people that I know that are different colored are pretty hilarious and sometimes make jokes about it.      Maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book",2,2,3,2,1
3022,2,"Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books @MONTH1 be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.     First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, @NUM1 year old boy, growing up in an all white town. Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child.      Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about.     Libraries are open to people of all age. It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area",5,4,5,4,5
3038,2,"Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a section made for adult readers only.  This way no children would see the book anyway.       If an offensive book is in a school or any other place that the readers are children for the majority than it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf.     All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience.",1,1,1,1,1
3040,2,"Should censorship be used on library books? Obviously if you are talking to an adult then yes, more than likely they don't want their pupils to be learning inappropriate words, but if you ask any student the same question you will probably get mixed answers. Some might say' I don't appreciate hearing or reading those words,' others might say' sure why not, I hear them on televison, see them on the internet, my parents say them so why can't I read them.' To me personally I don't think it's that big of a deal to have a few inappropriate words in a book, but they shouldn't be allowed on shelfs in a middle school's library or lower. High school and up I think that its okay to have on the shelves in magazines, books, music and movies.     When I was a child my mother always said don't cuss, but growing up in an enviornment where the overwhelming majority of people you talk to cuss, then after awhile it comes out like normal words. So why not have it in the books, and movies? It's not like we don't know what the words mean. If they hurt your feelings then you know not to read, listen or watch it again. I'm not saying cuss words are good and that it's ok for them to be in every sentence you say, but hearing or reading a few won't kill you.     In some cases, cuss words are good for a story. Sometimes your reading a book and someone gets in an argument, you don't even realize it till the argument is over, but with sometimes when there is a cuss word, you stop and say,' @CAPS1 something is going on here, and I want to know what it is.' @CAPS2 catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened.     Consequently; movies, books, music, and magazines with foul language does have an affect on our youth.  A lot of children are cussing at an early age, but thats just how people communicate, show emotions, and get someones attention. Censorship can take away a lot from a book, overall making it less interesting, so again I believe censorship should not be a deciding factor in choosing a book, movie, music or magazine. Choose it because it looks interesting and its something you might enjoy",4,4,4,4,4
3041,2,"There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.     First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof. High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted.     Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone.        Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games. Their lazyness causes obesity. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons. Children being obeast causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late.      In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures. There still time for change, so lets do something about it. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for good",5,4,3,3,3
3042,2,"I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think that books should be censored. There are no books, besides maybe math books, that @CAPS1'@CAPS2 offend at least one person or a group of people. Books are an important part of the learning system. If a certain book offends you then you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 have to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. @CAPS4's that simple. there is no need to over react to words on paper. Besides there are more important issues at the moment.     While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that. People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example. A better example would be the parents or gaurdians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose. One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through. As you can see if people can live with that then we can definantly handle an offensive book.      Censorship causes blidness. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive. All men are created equal, right? So they'd have to censor the book. If a book offends you that much then listen up, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Just because a book is offensive to you doesn'@CAPS2 mean @CAPS4's offensive to everyone. sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor @CAPS4 and then we @CAPS1'@CAPS2 learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them. The point is if a p erson can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper.",3,3,3,3,3
3046,2,"I belive if the books, music, movies, magazines and etc. are offensive and are bad that they should be removed, the reason being is because of younger children.       Younger children are not aloud to be exsposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertand to them. Since there are books, music, movies, magazines and etc. that are bad and offensive, then I would suggest a room or some sort of place that they can be held and were only adualts can be around them and can get to them.      Movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me. There are more bad things in them then in books or music. Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that. If there happen to be a book, music, movie, or magzine that you or any other person thinks that is inaproprete or offensive then you or that person would have permision to take it off and show it the main desk, and let them know what you think about it.     I feel that they should seperated the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe. They should steel be aloud to have censorship books, music, movies, and magazines because adult can handle that kind of material to where younger children can't. So therefore to keep everything sepreate, and there shouldnt be no problem.",2,2,2,2,2
3053,2,"Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of?  A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how @CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.       If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech.  Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it.  It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by.  If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone.  In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.     Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.  It will still be around.  It is just something in our world that we have to live with",4,4,4,4,4
3060,2,"Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason. The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.     The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition.     The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it. Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter.     The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves. The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.     In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is.",3,3,3,3,3
3063,2,"How would you feel if you wrote a story about your life, and someone found it offensive, so the took the book off of the shelves? I feel as if the censorship in libraries is becoming a controversial problem for the following reasons: it is wrong to take away freedoms, people have different opinions and views, and some books, magazines, or songs are trying to make people aware of dangers.     One important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is; it takes away our freedom of speech. In @LOCATION1, we have the right to speak our minds. If everything we read was censored, there would be nothing to read. The liberties and freedoms of @CAPS1 citizens should not be taken away because of something that is thought to be inappropriate.     Another reason why I believe censorship is wrong is; different people have completely different opinions on things. One person might feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive, while another person might think the book is informational and helpful. No one can base censorship on one belief or idea, because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of.      A third reason why censorship should not be inforced as much is; it takes away the awarness of the dangers in everyday life. Stories about people who were kidnapped, or were in a car crash because the person who was driving was under the influence of drugs, can be a good thing. Eventhough the story @MONTH1 have some accounts that are not appropriate, it could be very influencial, and convince someone to make the right choice. If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or people making the wrong choices, no one will be able to read a story about it and make the right choice instead of making the same mistake as the person.        Although stories or magazine articles that @MONTH1 be seen as vulgar are looked down upon, they help to make people aware, give people the freedom of speech, and allow them to have their own opinions. Censorship in libraries and media should be abolished",5,5,4,4,4
3071,2,"Definately not, they @MONTH1 be offensive to some but not all. Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life, so their is no real reason to censor materials. These materials are made to entertain someone, some are entertained by offensive material. I honestly dont think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be took out.      If any material offends you, you dont have to acknowledge it, you can always check out different material. If censor material then you are going against the first amendment, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored, what happens when every book has been marked as offensive? We have no books, thats what.          Books are made by the author writing down his idea's and creating a plot, some will think his idea's are offensive but not all will. Whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books. Anyone can create material and share their idea's, those idea's could still be offensive but it doesnt matter, because we have @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it. If you ban any type of material, your prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions, then all your doing is denying the @NUM1 amendment & being a hypocrite.      Censorship of music and movies is not right either. When you censor movies and music your also censoring out their idea's. Music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion. Censorship of the movies, music, & books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture. All im saying is censorship is destroying america and hurting our progression in culture.",4,3,3,4,3
3076,2,"Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area.     A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.     Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library. If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it.     Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed.     So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay. Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area",3,3,2,2,2
3095,2,"yes because what if a @NUM1 year old could find a offensive to have a book that talks about his race in a bad way. Now if a man walks in and finds a offensive book about his race he @MONTH1 take the shitchuration to a new level like maby he @MONTH1 demand it to be taking off the shelf or somthing else. If a women walks in with her son or daughter and find a dirty nasty book about sex, drugs, guns and knifes.     So yes a offensive book should be taken off a shelf if the book or books are in a public libeary. Only reason the books should be taken off the shrelf is because if its a public libeary alot of kids and their pearents to read, do research and do homework.     And that is why a public libaery should take a offensive book off their shelf",3,1,1,2,1
3104,2,"The media is destroying our youth! this is something we hear everyday. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning.     If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.     Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more.      Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see.  If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see.     Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives. If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop. They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship",6,5,5,5,5
3105,2,"Censorship in libraries should not be a big deal. There are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people. To solve the problem, everything should not be censored. Why can't those that find it offensive just steer clear of it? I believe it should be a persons choice to read something or not and if they find it offensive, they should simply put it down.     The book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' has offended many people. I have read it and was not offended. I found it very interesting and educational. Many people think the book should be censored. But if it is censored, the story would completely change and it would not be the same. I would have learned nothing instead of learning how people lived in @LOCATION1's history.      If all the books and magazines that were offensive to one person were taken off the shelves, and all the books offensive to another taken away, what would be left? Little kids books about kittens? Well that's just lovely.     I am very much against censorship. I believe that if a material is offensive to you, then you shouldn't read it or listen to it. But don't ruin it for the rest of us",4,4,4,4,4
3107,2,"Two of the many privaleges that we have as @CAPS1 are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work @MONTH1 be percieved as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others @MONTH1 not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity.     These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs.     Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living.     I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ingorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that @MONTH1 be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, '@CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'.     By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If @CAPS2 works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you. This type of literature provides usefull information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of @DATE1 that it actually was how people should not be living.",5,4,4,4,4
3115,2,"There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed.       Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done.     Some people find some offensive subjects interesting. For example, if someone found the @PERSON1 interesting they @MONTH1 want to just do some research to learn more about it. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects.     There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive. If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job.      I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removings books, magazines, music, etc. I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else",4,4,3,4,3
3116,2,"I think that if there are books, music @CAPS1, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar.           I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions. The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vuglar movies, books, music and magazines then they should come off the shelf.  Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things.     They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them. For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books. The kids can look at this stuff and see violence. For example they can see pictures of  men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example.     We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to. It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing. The library is a place where many people go to learn. It is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them",3,3,3,3,4
3119,2,"There are more than six billion people in the world. That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinons of all these distinct people. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but its likely that its something that the author feels passionate about and the author could be offended if his opinon was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world. Media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view. It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media.     There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about. It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically.      This is a very two-sided subject. It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them, and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before and just remvoing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited.      Libraries are already decreasing severly in their reveleance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them and its not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other reasources, like the internet, again.With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinon and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves.",4,5,5,4,5
3124,2,"Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? The question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves. I don't think they should.     I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. You can make that desicion. No one is making you watch or read any of that.     I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I choose to read them. No one forced the act on me.     Some of you @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature.     There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be bare.     You have a choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves.",5,5,4,5,5
3125,2,"Libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent.Some people like reading books about war and violence while others find it offencive. No matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive? They shouldn't! Every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. If all the books that were offencive to someone where takin off the shelf, there would be no more books left.     People walk into the library and most of the time books are labled by what they are about. They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normaly don't go to the section that they don't like. There is no reason to go to the section that they dont like becasue they wont be reading a book from there becasue they dont like it. They would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books. People have the choice to read a book or not so why bother even worry what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what thye have. If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book that is their buisness but other parents might want their child to soo what all is out there and develope their child's views on subjects.     Everyone has different views and ideas. If every one was the same the world would be boring and there would be notheing to talk about. By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music there is always somthing to talk about becasue not everyone knows the same subjects. Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to what differences there are in the world. Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are so if the books are not there for children to try and read they will never know what they like and do not like. A book a child likes @MONTH1 not be that a nother child likes or even an adult likes but that is normal, people are not the same.      If everyone took the books or music off the self that they found offensive there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves. Styles are most the time oppisits, like comedy and sad books. Most poeple who would like comedy wouldn't like sad and visa-versa there fore they would take the other off the shelf so neither would have anything to read or listen to. Even with some of the best selling books poeple wonder why or how so many sold but thats just how it is. People out there like the book so if one person didnt like it all those people would never have known what that book is about and @MONTH1 have changed their life. Books can be very impactfull in people's lives and if they never read that book the change would never have been made to their life.The world goes round becasue of differences and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas. everyone cannot be the same it just would not work.      Libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it. People have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting. Moreover, if everyone tooks books and music off the shelves they did not like there would not be very many books and music left. So if you run into a book or some music you dont like just ignore it, dont read it or listen to it. Things will be much simpler in the long run.",5,4,3,4,3
3126,2,"Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished.     In this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. The will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around. It's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there.     Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship. It @MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener. On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless.        In my experence I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images.     Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things @MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating and music @CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves. The first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world.",4,3,3,3,3
3131,2,"Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it?     Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things.     Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent.      Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libaries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child.",4,4,4,4,4
3133,2,"To begin with I feel everyone should admire the libraries. I feel this way because at one point of time we didnt even have books let alone libraries to get books from. A library is a place that has a peacful and calm environment. People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music and aslo to relax.    So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the selves at the library if found offensive?' @CAPS1, I believe if things are on the shelf that @MONTH1 come off offensive to people they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment were things are offending you. If things seem to come off offending, it will make indivuals stop coming to the library. This will make the library loose alot of business due to lack of service.    The library should be a place that consist of love, peace and harmony. It should be a place were people should feel free and relieved from any stress. By seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library. This also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be. They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library.  Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music shouldnt be found in a library. An  example of some offensive music is the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music, meaning the music with all types of different profanity. The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner. Also the music that's making it seem cool to be violent.    This will come off offensive to many men and women. Think about it who wants to listen to music thats makes women feel like their not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting and gangs etc. People whould like to hear more soothing and relaxing music. The music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in. The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied.  In conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax. It should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed. This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is",4,4,3,4,3
3145,2,"Censorship in libraries is not necassary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child",3,3,3,4,5
3147,2,IN MY OPINION I THINK THAT SOME BOOKS PROBABLY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF SOME OF THE BOOKS AREW FOUND OFFENSIVE. SOME OF THE MOVIES AND BOOKS PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE CAN BE PRETTY BAD AND SAY NASTY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.      SOME MUSIC CAN BE PRETTY OFFENSIVE TOO BECAUSE IT CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT ALL MUSIC IS BAD.. IT DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO IF IT SAYS NASTY THINGS BECAUSE THERE IS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TOO.,2,1,1,2,1
3149,2,"You know when you find a @LOCATION1 book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind see. Or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word. I see it more better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them stuff like will make the child think that's how your suppose to act and talk. Here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines.     First, in deal with music children word immate act they see and the words the say. One good example is rap music: their song have cuss words in them and believe me when I tell you this that I have to constantly to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this. In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines.     Second, with magazine some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are ment to be seen where children read. an example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from magazine I found a magazine on the table and it show three of the cast members from @LOCATION1 in their birthday suits. I thought what in the world is this doing at my school they should have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud. What do they think it want bother any kids' parent about it that I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had a something that at there school.     In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them.",2,2,2,2,2
3167,2,I think that all offensive materials should be removed from librarys so every one can read a book listen to music and watch movies with out being offended. They shuld have there own section for that kind of material.                                                     Movies that are bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a section just for those movies. The sction should be locked up so children can't get those movies. I think that this would be fair for everyone.      Music that is bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a section just for that kind of music. The section should be locked up so children can't get that kind of music. I think that this would be fair for everyone.      Magazines that are bad should be taken off the shelf. These magazines should have a section just for those magazines. They should be locked up. I Think that this would be fair for every one. Books that are bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a secton just for these books. these books should be locked up so children cant get them. I think that this would be fair for everyone.     This is what I think should be done with this offensive materials. If this was done everyone would have a book to read  a magazine to look at music to listen to and a movie to watch,4,4,3,3,4
3169,2,"'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views.     A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightnement. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on @CAPS5 but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? @CAPS1 goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another.      Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inapropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not aloud to roam the library without an adult. @CAPS1 is a very prominant rule because it sets boudaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults.      Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries beacuse they are found offensive becuase @CAPS1 is censorship and it takes away our rights.",4,4,4,4,4
3171,2,"Our founding fathers creating amendments for the people.  One of the greatest is the freedom of speech.  Censorship of offessive materials is unnecessary.  Books, music, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 have bad messages or nudity, but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them.  Book burning happened because of the dislike of people's writing.  People have the right to say how they feel by any medium.  Censorship of anything makes a child more immature.     Book burning is a horrible action by any person.  People used to burn them because of all the sex, drugs, and violence, but doing this destroys people's dreams, theories, and ideas.  In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, firemen would burn any book seen within a home.  Almost ever single book in the world is not factual, unless it is nonfiction.  The firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government.  That basically means every kind of book out there.  The causation of such a tragedy was that every citizen befriended their television or video games.  Without books there would be no real sort of entertainment.  Also, the things we read everyday are what make us who we are so there, in fact, should not be less books but more.     Libraries have no right to censor books.  Freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation.  Why should it change now?  Stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out.  They @MONTH1 have already written their ideas, but if nobody reads their work then there is no way that they'll be heard.  Libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids' ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs.     Parents have always stopped their precious babies from watching certain shows and movies.  I once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the @PERSON1 series because of the use of sorcery.  She believed that he would try to learn witchcraft.  I found that quite ridiculous when I heard about it.  When a kid watches murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with bits of nudity, it is different to them and they are curious.  After watching these kind of scenes, a parent needs to sit down with their child and talk about what they jus saw.  The child needs to know that killing is wrong and justice is good and magic and dragons don't exist.  Nudity has always been considered a bad thing but penises and boobs are part of the human body.  Kids will be more mature about it the more they see it, but that doesn't the child should watch porn.     Censory has always been taken the wrong way.  People believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about.  We should not get rid of the obscenity at all.  We should have an understanding of the bad things in life.  Burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind.  Freedom of speech is a law and should be followed.  Censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter",5,4,4,4,5
3182,2,"There are many diffrent people in this world, who have many diffrent oppions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc., @CAPS1 because one person dose not perticualy like horor movies, that dose not mean that movies stores should remove horor films from there shelves. as creepy as it @MONTH1 sound. there are many people in the world who are slasher film freeks. the live and breath scarry movies. I myself like @CAPS1 about eveything out there. i will read any book of listen to any type of music, it actualy widens my taste in certain materials. i feel like everyone should try new things. Say growing up your favorite books were @CAPS2 The @CAPS3. and you would like to shaire your childhood stories with your children. BUT @CAPS4, books stores took @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This is nonsince. many people like many diffrent things.there is no reason to only sell what you like. otherwise your busines will fail.",2,2,2,3,2
3184,2,"Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, suchs as schools and tv shows intended for young children. Things that aren't intendend for young children should not be censored. If you were to censore everything because some people find it offensive then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community.     Censoring books, moives, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a wast of time. If you were to take a book off a shelf that explaind the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 because a person found it offensive then we would never make advansis in technology. Cenosoring items like books is just plane idiotic and ignorant. Studing matireal is our only way to advance in seiance, and if we can't get the right books to studie because they were taken off the shelf due to it being offensive then we will never make brakethoughs in technology.      Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really arent good parents. If they really were consurend with thouse topics then they shouldn't buy them the moives or the books that they find offensive. It seems that parents want to proclaim they want to censore that items because they find it offensive. But not all parents feel the same way, some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their chilren are mature enough to handle things like these.     As a child I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations. I grew up with out censoreship. I wacthed movies and read book that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all ment. I see why parents want to censore that kids from topics like thouse, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topic and see if that are mature enough to hanld it.     Censoreship is great for childrens tv shows. But when you start to censore someones ideas because you find them offensive and wrong then you are being ignorant. People here have freedom of speech and desirve the right to not have there work censored because a small group finds it offensive. Censoreship is a great tool, if used right",2,2,3,3,2
3187,2,"The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others. Whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many peoples point of views it shouldn't be available to the public.       I personally beleive that if something is seen as volgure and offence it shouldnt be displayed. Millions of people will be viewing this and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it. Why would anyone else want the opposite? Kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child. We all want to bring our kids up right and letting them have availabilty to negative material is uncalled for.  Its not only kids either that are affected, adults also are affected by the media. Adults can get fooled too, beleive me.      I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason. I beleive that what the librarians did was right. Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things. Some students @MONTH1 not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student.      I beleive that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough I stand for whoever it is that did it. Nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child. There should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities",3,2,2,3,4
3188,2,"I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @NUM1 to @NUM2, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of.          When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life.                So thats what my person input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.",2,2,2,3,2
3191,2,"When have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf? Have you ever read a book half way through and questioned why you are reading it? Why would you read a book that you know you're not going to like?     If someone has the right and the authority to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then I have the exact same right as them. I thought everyone was treated by equal rights. When i ever do read I always read the back of the book or whats called the summary of the story so I can see if I'm going to like it or not. If I know a book is going to offend me or a magazine or even a movie, most likely I'm not going to even bother giving my attention to them.     Obviously the author doesnt like censorship or she wouldnt be arguing about it. It's obviously something that bothers her and everyone is intitiled to their own beliefs and disbeliefs. I respect people that stand up for themselves and find the hardest ways out of hard prediciments. I can say I always go to libraries and read books because I'm not a reader. But i can tell you if I ever did go to a library and i found a book on the shelf that offends me its probably going to offend someone else. So why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion. But i think if it's going to offend someone in praticular it's probably going to bother someone else. I'm not saying everyone is alike but most people believe in things that other people believe in. People can hav the same agreements and disagreements.     I do have to agree with @PERSON1 because she is right. You would be amazed on the amount and different things people can get offended by. I have tons of experiences of movies, books, music, and magazines that have offended me. But I didnt let it pull me down or anything. For example I stopped watching the movie, and I stopped reading the book that bothered me. You can't wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe. @CAPS1't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your opinions. If certain things offend you, @CAPS1't let them bother you just stop doing what your doing and move on to something else.     Like I said I have had alot of experiences of offensive things I have read and watched. Like awhile back I watched a movie that had a black man in it and he was locked in prison and killed in prison for being accused of something he didn't do. It was just because the time era and it was also because he was black. Thats the kind of stuff that really upsets me. Because we are all the same. We @MONTH1 look different and see things different. But our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air. I have always gone by the saying, '@CAPS1't ever judge a book by it's cover until you read it.'     So whatever people @MONTH1 think I believe in one thing and it's to let people believe in things they want to believe in. @CAPS1't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel. I agree with Katherine Paterson.",5,4,4,4,3
3193,2,"Certain people beleive that offensive books, magazines, or music should be taken off of the shelves of libraries. I think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves. It is a persons own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so. It is also not another persons right to decide what other people can and cannot observe. If certain offensive things were taken off of the shelves of libraries such as music, books etc. the knowledge of people would be limited to only what the library or the government would want them to know and that is not right.     It is someones personal decision wether or not they look at listen to or read offensive things. People shouldn't be sheltered by society and only know what is wanted for them to know. If libraries eliminated offensive media then people would be able to form their own oppinions and ideas. In some cases reading and knowing certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world. One case is how people should know about the holocaust in the @DATE1. Im shure reading about the holocaust is very affensive to copius amounts of people, but even though this history is disturbing and offensive people should know about it so that history does not repeat itself.      The government and society does not have the right to decide what people take in. For example what if all of a certain type of music was eliminated from libraries, the internet, and tv; it would slowly dissolve out of  existence. Certain things like reading about the times before racial equality, and such things as slavery are very offensive for people to read about. But these things must be read and heard and passed down through history so it isn't forgotten.      The knowledge of offensive things should not be taken away from people by the libraries. Yes offensive things shouldnt be celebrated or looked upon as good but people should know. People in the world cant just know the good things or only what their society wants them to know, they also have to know about the bad things and offensive things that happen and have happened as well.",3,4,3,3,3
3216,2,"Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the oppurtunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music all for free and for a certain period of time.  When people grow up, they tend to start reading, watching, and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to.  Since books are read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books should not be taken from the shelves and only very bad movies and music should leave the library.     Books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world.  Normally when people read a book, they don't read it in a group unless they are in a reading group discussing certain books.  If someone wanted to read a book that was innappropriate for their children, let them do it; it's not hurting the children that they have been reading innappropriate topics, it will only hurt them if that child finds the book that should have been hidden in a better place.  For example, @PERSON1 read the book 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', which had some innappropriate content for a child in there, but not so bad that it would be heinous.  @PERSON1 will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children; this scenario is how it should be.  Although, if a library is putting adult books near children's books, they need to redesign to keep kids from accidentally walking into the adult section.  Books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough, but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner.     Movies and music are a great way to kick back and relax after a long day, unless your kids are around.  Keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task, whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall.  Music can of course be listened to through headphones, but what happens when you leave a @CAPS3 is left in the car and a child is sent in that car to wait for his parents to get in?  The parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away.  The movies and music were from the library, a place where the child thinks that there would never be something such disgraceful material as what their parents are watching and listening to, ruining their good thoughts of the library.  Libraries need to either get rid of all nasty content pertaining to movies and music or if their main business is that and can't seem to give it up, just put the content as far away as possible from the children.     As said above, libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds.  Libraries are a place where kids can have fun picking out whatever book they wish to read, not a place where parents can pick up items that might spoil that child's brain",5,5,5,4,5
3227,2,"Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. Library now days have alot of offensive language in there books so if someone were to take all of the book like that out of the library then library wouldn't even have that many books in it. Music is the same way all music now days might have some offensve words in them thats just something people now days have to get over.          I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parent might not like the idea of there librarys haveing offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If the parent don't want there children to not read those book then they need to chose there childrens book, but I think takeing all the offensive book of the shelves isn't very smart. Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.           Some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in then like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road. So if you take those books off the shelves and werent able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things. They really wouldnt know the side effects and bad thing that could come out of those things. Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in then and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice word in them.I know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.     If there are book you dont want youself to read then don't read them. I think it would be unfair to take everthing that have some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read. Its not fair to people who @MONTH1 enjoy those books to not have the luxary to read those book anymore cause a few parent got mad about a book. Some of the old books have alot of racism in them, and you actually @MONTH1 read some of them in a school for a class. Those book @MONTH1 also have bad language in them to. Take thing those books away from us @MONTH1 take away are education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should.          So i think that censorshipn in library is just a horrible idea. It can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life",2,2,2,2,2
3230,2,"I thank that all of the books and movies and more should not  be censorship because people have a right to no what they what to no or see.      They need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that @CAPS1 war @NUM1 want happen again.     The libraries is for freeom to read to do want you want and look up.     In the newspaper and magazines people like to no that happens in the @CAPS1 or to people if its bad or not, because no how that cant happen to them, some people mite thank that people not read watch something but are they to tell what to do they can there own dishens",1,1,1,1,1
3231,2,"I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life. She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for.      After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow.     She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.     After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.      The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's total fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone",3,3,4,3,3
3232,2,"Do you believe that certain materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experince, observations, and/or reading.           I do believe that if it's a book you not suppose to get, if it's not for age group, don't get it. Some libraries contains books that's highly not appropriate for children, they have sections for adults and children to check out books. Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books.The library is  a plcae with all types of books, so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book.           When I first went to the library for the time I didn't know what book to check out, so the librarian should me my section by showing me my age group. By then I was checking out books that was appropriate for my age, magazines I didn't care to much about, I just wanted to read a whloe book.              In conclusion, when ever you nedd a book good or check out your section, make the book is appropriate for you and feed you mind with knowledge.",2,2,2,2,2
3235,2,"Why Censorship @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     In our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense.  Some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there.  Everybody doesn't want there children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen.  We just have to teach our kids what @CAPS1 good and what @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  This goes for literary items too.  We need to have faith in our kids that they will do what @CAPS1 right.  I think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive.  I think we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries.     Now days, there @CAPS1 a lot of hard work that goes into music, movies, and books.  If we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended that in itself.  The people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece.  They spent countless of hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get somone to film their movie idea.  I think that it would be wrong to outrule peices of great literature because behind every one of them, there @CAPS1 a person that put a lot of effort into that material.     In every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it.  The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says @PERSON2 had a wife and had children.  This book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened, it @CAPS1 just a story full of conspiracy theories.  You can still believe what you want and read this book.  A movie that could be considered offensive just by the title @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 Can't @CAPS8.  Many people hear this title and @MONTH1 not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminant against @CAPS6 people, but instead it @CAPS1 a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball.  Many things have offensive language but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories.  They are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe.     In our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things.  In our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like what ever we want.  Even though literary might be offensive, some people like reading books like this.  If I look in the library, I could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book.  Even though it @CAPS1 disrcimanting against me, I could still love the book.  There @CAPS1 always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it.  Why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday.     Like Katherine Paterson said, if she has the right to take a book off of the shelf, then so does everyone else.  If we let everybody take books off the shelves, then there will be none left.  We cannot control everything that people do.  Taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them, but this will decline the library usage, and people will slowly stop reading.  If they don't like the books at the library, then they won't have problem with not reading at all.  I think that censorship in our libraries would be a @CAPS2 idea, and I think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries",3,3,3,3,3
3239,2,"I strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out the library. It not okay for you too say one thing and something your child found in the library say it okay. what if you were talking to your kids about not smoke and how it bad for them and could potentially kill them, would you like you child to say that i can smoke because all this character in the book are smoking? No that not right it just pure wrong. They shouldn't allow those kinds of books, music, movies, or magazine in the library.     In high school we were told by our parents that we should not smoke do drugs or anything like that. Sometimes it might be hard to believe the things your parents talked to you about and how harmful they are to you and your body and would lead you to a trouble life down the road. Movie we watch today talk about doing drugs and how cool they are and how they had fun driving a stolen car. it wrong to talk about them that way because it get teens to think it okay for them to do it and nothing bad is going to happen. The media does a bad job of showing teens it not right to do the things they see on tv. The library set a bad example by allowing those kinds of books to sit on the shelves and think it okay for people to read them and not take it offensive.      I was reading a book that was talking about how they think it okay to act rascist aganist other people and say mean thing and call them bad name. I really took that offensive because i wouldnt like someone calling me name and saying bad things about me because they think it okay to say things like that and act that way. If books say all those things and the readers actually believe them, then we might have a problem in our hands because some people would take offensive to it and cause a big issue over a small book and some readers might think its okay and cause even a big issue between people who take it offensive and people who dont take it offensive.     There are those people out there who think that it okay for those kind of books to be in the library and other people who think it wrong and offensive. My personal view is that i think it wrong to have those kind of books at the library. We tell people how it wrong to do bad things and how we hate certain things that are offensive to us, but it say that in the book that it alright for those thing to be happening or it right to use those foul language. I just think it personal wrong to say those kind of things in movies. music, books,or magazines are okay to be in the library yet alone in the people it self.",3,3,3,3,3
3240,2,"what i think about all of this? Is that to me i really don't care because that is like who i am. And its up the parents if they want the to remove the books off the shelf if they believe that a certain material as book, music, movies, and magazing should be remove off the shelves. Also i dont think a book will ever really hurt anyone. I mean its just a book it dose not really matter.     Next, i am saying this becuse i dont really would get offensive to stuff like this argument. And also if there some stuff that kids shouldnt know about then they should  put those stuff in the adult section and not a place where they can find it easy. They shouldn't put stuff that you think children should never know about in the kids section.     Matter of fats i don't know why they should  remove stuff like movie. Becuse if they are trying to block them form kids to see they are really dumb to do that. Beause there are moive that children can watch. And some parents is not going to let their children watch a @CAPS1 @NUM1 movies, and other movie they were not to see at there ages. Unless if their parents allowe it.And that goes with the same with the music. I don't know if they have bad music in the library.I don't see rap stuff in the library.like raps @CAPS2 and other stuff like it.So this is my thought about this arguments",2,1,1,1,1

3249,2,"There is a type of boundary that @MONTH1 restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books.  This is called censorship.  However @CAPS3 you @MONTH1 not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library.  @CAPS3 would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are to horrrific or to adult like for their own good?  This is the question that plauges them every year with new shipments of books.  Although yes that seems terrifying it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons;  The congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in  all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve.       First of the arguements that can be held is the freedom of press.  This law was enacted in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and is still in effect today.  If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children then he or she @MONTH1 do so without penalizations.  Children @MONTH1 read it yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author.  If so then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves.  It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer.      When it comes to the arugements of @CAPS3 to do on censorship the freedom of thought pops into most minds.  This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think @CAPS3 they will of anything.  Just as the freedom of press an indiviudal can pick up that book for adults and read it.  No matter the age they are.  If they are discouraged by it then by all means let them put it down, however, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in childrens novels let them continue learning.       A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember.  This is not scientificly proven but when you are around children constantly you notice this.  Just as a babies mind is a sponge it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years.  When they are allowed to read any book and not sit infront of a television screen all day they learn more.  Now someone can come along and say:  '@CAPS3 if the book is a fantasy?'.  It's no different.  The storyline is not @CAPS3 teaches them, it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge.  An educated man can sometimes get tounge-tied with words where as if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit they are able to use words with great ease.  It is not allways the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events?     All in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public.  There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap.  Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someones ability to learn a new word or gramatical law.  If one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books.  It would be a scary day if that happened.  For it would not be something that went well in our history.  Since humankind has had writing we became more intelligent, taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings.  So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them.  Not just because they can learn far greater with a book as a resource, but that the two congressional laws say it should be",4,4,5,5,5
3250,2,"Some books in libraries offended some people. But other people want to read this book. None persone have right to say this book offended me so should the libraries removed it.

If some one don't like this book and this book offended them.They shold don't read this book and read what they like. but son't say should be removed this book. I think evey one like different books.

3254,2,"Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries. The @CAPS1 used it in the @CAPS2 colonies during the @CAPS2 @CAPS4 to keep the colonists loyal to the crown. The @CAPS5 used censorship not just during the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as a brand of propaganda, but also during @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 under @CAPS12 guidance. Censorship is still in use in the @LOCATION1 today, as a way to 'protect the children'. The @ORGANIZATION1 tells the @CAPS2 public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy. Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism.     As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? Where do we draw the line? Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term.     I recently read a book titled '@CAPS14', by @PERSON2, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal @LOCATION2, and the life he had after his mother's death in the @CAPS15 capital of @LOCATION3. @PERSON2's work includes some passages that are less than angelic, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished. @PERSON2's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that @CAPS16 face in the changing landscape of their @CAPS7, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort.     All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing? Some censorship is good, and a fact of life. But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line? Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state? Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the @CAPS17, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all @CAPS2 citizens. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, '@CAPS19 me liberty, or @CAPS19 me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all.",6,5,6,6,5
3255,2,"If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material.  Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction.  No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way.  Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional?     Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others @MONTH1 have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way. Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion.     The cenorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong.  You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it.      I go to the library once in a while,and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel  the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down.  I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me?  I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that someone else's opinion and not my own.      If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it",2,2,2,3,2
3258,2,"Library @CAPS1:                                    @CAPS2 or bad?      It is a very rare occasion that i go to the library, i'm a typical guy, i like sports, video games, and hanging with my friends. When im not in school i try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries. Those very rare occasions when i do go to the library, for a summer reading book for school, i usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves. Some of the stuff i see at libraries catches my eye, and not because it looks like a @CAPS2 book, but because it's shocking to see what they allow to be even put on the shelves.     On the book shelves that i have walked by i have seen romance novels and they arent as bad as i would have thought, at first they catch my eye with the titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary. I feel that these books aren't innapropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre teens should'nt be reading them. So as long as there is seperation between the kids section and adult section then i think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels up on the shelves because they are types if literature.     Now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way. Gossip magaziines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive. The problem with magazines alot of the writing is people's opinions and they could be talking in a very negative wasy about some people or some things. I think its up to the library to make a decision on that but if someone complains about it i think the library should be kind enough to take it off of the shelf. They are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes, and i feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all. I've seen parents walk into a library and their son asked them why that magazine had a half naked lady on it and i just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug there parents all day about what they saw at the library.     Music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands. Now a days @CAPS3 cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory, so i feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases. Movies are the same way, they have ratings. If the librarian see's a @NUM1 year old kid trying to check out a rated @CAPS4 movie then she should be fired, because there is cleary no reason why she would do that. Excuses cant come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not. Now @CAPS5 movies should not be in libraries at all, libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to. Pornography in a library is like haveing strippers in school, it is just not ethical.      In conclusion i feel that cencorship in libraries is a @CAPS2 thing to have. If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in ares that they shouldn't be then everything should be fine",3,3,3,3,3
3260,2,"'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere.     To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well its not; banning books, music, etc. is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity. It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past.     Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remeber the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions.     A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away.     While yes, there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing",3,3,3,3,3
3262,2,"How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen somthing that you think no other kid should see? Im going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries. After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace.      Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happends and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn?      The books that children read varys. The younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read @MONTH1 have words in it to display a seriouse part to the story, or a tragic monment in the characters life. Some @MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it.       Authers usally vary their vocabulay in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the @DATE1's why would they try and clean up the grammer that was spoken from that time. Try and change what the reader might think about that time.      Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear someing oddensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in",3,3,3,3,3
3265,2,"A very wise man in @CAPS1 life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him. @CAPS4 went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a @CAPS2, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As @CAPS4 grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. @CAPS4 had no example of how to behave, yet @CAPS4 stayed away from @CAPS3, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography.      As I have been growing up with @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a hard working individual and having @CAPS1 mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, @CAPS1 parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' @CAPS4 had a valid point. In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers.      What has the world come to when a child of age eight @MONTH1 walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and @CAPS5 have the book there at all.      Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered. Well what if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD @CAPS5 have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is @CAPS5 the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest asured that their child is safe from the filth of inmoral things",5,4,5,4,4
3268,2,"Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right? To read them well thats what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf.      I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves. Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and @MONTH1 offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience.     Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening.     So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things.     This is why I think books that offend some people should't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf. Just as they are today in our local library",4,4,4,4,4
3281,2,"At a local library you can find hundreds of books, all of different matter, a different style and of different stories. Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine. No one is the same, we all have different likes and interest.      Some people @MONTH1 find certain books distrubing and inapporiate, that the book shouldnt be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries. That is only some people, what one person finds distrubing and gross another person can find interesting. Not one person is the same so not all books are going to be eye ctaching and interesting to every person. If one person finds a book to be inapporaite, yet another finds it interesting and suggest that book to their friends, is that one whom disagress upon the reading material as unexceptable to thier community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it. Everyone should be given the same oppertunity to read the book that another made find inapporaite.     People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only. A child in the library can wonder over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those women, that mother doesnt want her child to be able to pick up and porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library. You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazine in adult stores where childern wont be able to view them. Now some books @MONTH1 have a naked picture in the text but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well educate the people in our society about the matter. Books of diseases that @MONTH1 have nude photos should be allowed, they educate the communitry and save lives. Although not one persons voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, we all should be heard. Books are as of the same way, they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitment, sorrow and anger. We all have different hungrys for different reading, music and fashin.     In this world today, in our society, and in our community there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library. Books were created by different people, who dont share the same views,who look upon life in a different way, whose voices arent all the same. The book has a curse word in the text, that doesnt mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community. That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life.       Everyone has different views, likes, interest, wants and needs. Not one person shares the same hunger of reading material. We should all be given the oppertunity to read or not read what another person finds inapporaite. The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unexecptable for the shelves of their local library. Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implyed with the pursuite to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person. Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many imapporaite context is included.Let everyone read as they please and let everyone be marry in what they read",3,3,3,3,3
3283,2,"i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc.",2,2,2,2,2
3291,2,"Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.     Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.     The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.      The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them.",4,4,5,5,5
3292,2,"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries. Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another. I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored.      An idea that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensice to the other, and vice versa. Someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion @MONTH1 believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs. In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that. Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves. If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left. Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions. The @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offensive to someone of @CAPS2 religion, and because of that the @CAPS1 would not be able to be sold. If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it. Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another.     If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall. When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us. If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended. Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves. I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere. If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors @MONTH1 say forget it and not even right anymore. It is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone. Also, attraction to literature would seize. People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested. Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored.     If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same. Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education. Some teenagers including me @MONTH1 find some of the material they read-even in school-to be offensive or have a touchy subject. I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future. These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read. Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book. The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored.     A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life. An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist. One book that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same. For all of these reasons, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.",4,5,4,4,5
3300,2,"Censorship in liraries, in my opinion is over-rated. Everywhere you hear of book, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? I say no because, future generations need to know of the material, it @MONTH1 not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read.     Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. I say this is because of the censorship in libraries. Katherine paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chilren have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. An then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelve because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broder view as so many people are lucky to have today.     Everyone has a different oppinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person see's a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The @CAPS1, because the think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The @CAPS1 is a big part in history and it being catorgorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten.     Lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offesive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the one's that could pick for them.     With so many different oppinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, I believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.",3,3,4,4,3
3301,2,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,      @CAPS3, my name is @PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to there own opinion. People @MONTH1 not want there kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them were there kids cant find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies, books, and music that childreen listen to, watch, or read.     I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything. Adults @MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv. But, if there kids wanna learn about things that happen thats not the greatest, then people should let them.     It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen. Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way.     I'm sure many people @MONTH1 not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way.     Sincerely,      @PERSON1",2,2,2,2,2
3305,2,"Why should books or other such ideas but lets get back to the subject. Should certain books be aloud to be in a libary. Cause if u dont have certain books you would have to read the same book over and over. But there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have history,poems,dramas,love,scary. But some are not aporpit for certain places.     Certain music is ok but there are some that I would not aprove of. Like there rap its a bunch of people rymes. That people think up in there heads about life. Something that they want to express by telling raping. There is rock in roll alot of people did not care for it.     When it was intruduces in the late @NUM1 but as time went on people started listening to it. But alot of people did not want there kids listening. To that back then they said it was devil music. But in this day in age alot of people still listen to rock n roll. Cause they were brought up on that kind of music.     Movies there is a lot of diffent movies out there. There @NUM2 and rated @CAPS1 but alot of partents do not let there kids. Watch certain movies because they scare there kids. They are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it. But there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter.     Magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out. But mostly old people read magazines cause they have alot of time on there hands. But there are some people who cant get ehogh of magazines. Cause they want to buy every thing in the book. It catchs there eyes bye the way it looks . But there is all kinds of diffent magazines mucle, food ,cleaning, toys.      But thats what I think about this kind . Of stuff it sucks people in but some cant get out. By the time they get out they are broke",2,2,2,2,2
3310,2,"Cooling the @CAPS1: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 From Book @PERSON1 _________     Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are incapable of judgment.     To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the @CAPS5, precludes the idea of this censorship.     If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.     From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of @CAPS4 issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.     Here lies the problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. But books cannot shout their values. They cannot shove information down our throats. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.     If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well.     In the past few years, with the effects of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 reaching the newest generation, @LOCATION1 has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of @CAPS8 and of the @CAPS9. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. As such, architects have created what @MONTH1 be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?     This is the effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. Let the reader decide its value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance for it @MONTH1 have a power that is unrealized. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.",6,6,6,6,5
3313,2,"I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others.     There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.     The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read.     So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone",2,2,3,3,3
3315,2,"Over time, libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read. They have been used as a gate way for an extensive world of reading and learning. All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on thier shelves. No book, music, movie, magazine , etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelve because of it's content.         Sex, drugs, violence. There are many books over these topics that many people @MONTH1 find offensive or just completely oblivious. Every mind is diffrent when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch or hear. No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing. When ever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it. It should be placed on a different section of the library.           Many books that people find as explicit content to them, @MONTH1 not be to others. When i was in middle school, i heard alot about sex, and drugs. I never knew what it felt like or how did it feel. What i did know was that I could get accesible information from my local library. What happens when a child wants to know more than she does? She looks, and researches it. If i would have been denied the access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probabaly never been warned about the out comes or the seriousness of them both. When you walk into a libraby and observe. Not everyone is reading a book about rainbows, and unicorns. Many people read books about the real life, books that they can relate to. Many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit. The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kind of content, reguardless of others concerns.            Also, Libraries can do many things so that certain contents @MONTH1 not be near others. They can organize there topics and genres. Explicit, or eighteen or older books, movies, magazines or music @MONTH1 be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library. Far from the reach where kids and children are able to access.            In conclusion I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines,  music or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelve no matter what. No book should be removed because someone @MONTH1 find it offensive. If a person finds something offensive they should take it up with the author or publishers not the library for they only let people borrow the conten",4,3,3,3,3
3322,2,"Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1,           Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? No, I do not think they should be removed. I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age.      Like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section. The younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self. Then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section. Even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too.      It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. For example, if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults.      So yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project. Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager. That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate.     Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age. It would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection",3,3,3,2,2
3324,2,"Libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it. I think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them. There are three reasons why they should have censorship. First they can teach kids bad things, second bad influence, and third they just dont need to be there.     First was they can teach kids bad thing. That is because they would start looking at it more. Then they would get in trouble. There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all.     Second, its a bad influence. They go and tell and show there friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right. Makeing then do stuff and then have a bad future.     Third there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it. Like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor. But there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it.     I think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life",2,2,2,2,2
3337,2,"Katherine Paterson, a well-known author, presents an idea with which I strongly agree.  She states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us.'  If everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate, there @MONTH1 not be anything left for people to read.     Although it is a good thing for parents to have a voice and stand up for what they believe, books should not be banned.  Many people have different views on what is right and wrong.  Some @MONTH1 suggest that a certain book is obscene, while others @MONTH1 be offended by a different book.  If every parent had the right to get a book banned, there @MONTH1 come a time when no books meet the approval of the parent.     Some of these books present great learning opportunities to students.  Books often allow students to think in different, new ways.  They can learn from a new point of view.  Often times, a student can look at his or her own morals and values, which is a good thing.  If a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate, parents should respect the decision of this teacher.  They @MONTH1 suggest another reading, or offer other ideas, but to go as far as getting the book completely removed is not right.     While removing books for reading @MONTH1 be going to far, things such as movies could go the other direction.  Personally, my parents would be horrified to see grotesque, inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them.  I think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: Books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do.  Because of this, even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing.  If one was to walk past a book they did not intend to read, they do not have to be apalled at the cover as they pass.     Although parents care about the things their children read, books should not be banned.  Although other things @MONTH1 have affects on youth, books are a different story.  They allow one's self to dive deep into thought, to make observations, and to form opinions.  They are a key to growing, learning, and discovering.",3,3,3,3,3
3338,2,"First off, I do like censorship laws to an extent.  However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem innapropriate.  I think it depends more on what the family deems innapropiate.     I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages.  I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content.  I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it.  They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it.     However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magaines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else.  And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them.  But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about innapropriate material.  As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it.     I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials.  One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privilages to books, because they deem it innapropriate.  Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it.     Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials.  However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings.",2,3,2,2,3
3339,2,"There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do?      Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music",5,5,5,4,5
3344,2,"Offensive media is everywhere. From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or  any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they @MONTH1 become violent or depressed. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediatley.     Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they @MONTH1 imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind.      Another reason why  libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing , so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy.      Finally , inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a @CAPS1  in a magazine, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they @MONTH1 want to try and experiment with drugs  themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them.      Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media , they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which , inturn , can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy. With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths ,and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted , with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves",4,4,4,4,4
3352,2,"Yes because children should not be reading anything thats is like that. Children snhould be reading a book that haves good information in there and information the children should be learning while they are in class. Well if the books, music and other stuff to read and look have bad stuff in it should be removed from the shelf because children should not be looking at it. Some music has bad language in it and children should not be listening to music like that. Also movies that have inapproriate scenes in it should be watched by children becaus eits not good for the children to see all that and parents should do something about if their children is watching movies with inapprroiate scenes in it and magazines that have inapproiate pictures because children are too young to see that.",1,1,1,1,1

If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention.      If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it.     If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it",2,2,2,2,2

If so found there the children would'nt read it because it's too long for them and the book doesn't have any pictures in the book. Music is offensive but like I said only found in the adult area. Kids aren' interesting in music at that ageso they would'nt bother to see them. Movies and Magazines have offensive things in it and can be found any where, but found in a library is gonna be rare. The only thing you will find in a library that is offensive is gonna be a magazine.they make a bunch of different type of them, and can be found anywhere.

I'm gonna talk about '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book has a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, racism. @CAPS3 book is so offensive that the childrens parents would'nt let them read it, but @CAPS3 book is based on a true story. Everything that happened in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book.     Everything @MONTH1 be offensive to you in one way, but looking from the other point of view it's a learning experience. People that made those mistake could tell the childrens that those stuff aren't wroth it. Everything has it's purpose. The books can tell you the story of peoples life, and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it. Music can tell you the life of people by poetry. Magazines really dont have a point their just there to gossip",2,2,2,2,2
3361,2,"Some people @MONTH1 think that certain book, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they @MONTH1 be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material.      What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slighly rude, another person @MONTH1 have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truely offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is intitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definiton of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's.      I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Basically, I do not believe in '@CAPS3'. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some @CAPS4 @MONTH1 find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting.      I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is intitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be controdicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf.      In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truely be defined as offensive. Also, people should be able to speak their minds. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid there shelves of 'offensive' material",4,4,4,5,4
3364,2,"Censorship is important. Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves?     I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world",3,3,4,3,3
3365,2,"Censorship in Libraries     I know as well as everyone else does, that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library. There is all different kinds of stuff in there. From children's books, to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. Everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want?     I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library, for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate. For people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library. Nobody can really help with what people @MONTH1 find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place. You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but, what if the internet doen't have what you're looking for? I like books better then internet myself. Anybody can put information on the computer, but atleast when it's in a book, it's true, because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public.     If the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not suppose to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach. Put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area. You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there. All the libraries I've ever been to, had their own sections, the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to their's. If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library. Make your own at home, then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there",3,2,3,3,4
3370,2,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - @PERSON1     If one thinks about it books are such a magical escape from everday life. They can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime. Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all.I feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books.      Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be @CAPS5 or placed into circulation. This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing. So much would be left unsaid. I believe the quote stated above is quite true. If we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all. No one should we withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor.      If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant.No one neccessarily said anything mean or hurtful it just feels as if restritions and boundaries were set for no particular reason. I have felt this way multiple times. I remember one time in particular. I went to @LOCATION1 with a group of my cousins and their friends. Since I was the youngest I was also the shortest. I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size. I knew why those heighth requirements were set, for my personal safety. This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a tv show. Honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster. Everyone is different. Everyone has a different personality and different perspective, there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different. One should not be ineligible to @CAPS5 a book or magazine or watch a movie. Not wanting to is totally differnet from not getting to.       The popular book To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 was banned at one time in the @LOCATION2 simply for using the 'n-word'. This angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 affected and shaped us into who we are today. America is a great nation because of the @ORGANIZATION1.Do we need to have a @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5!Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms?  If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship",5,4,5,4,5
3372,2,"Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. Everybody should have they own section for their age group.          Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. It's to much cursing and violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things.          There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things.          I think they should be certain magazines in the library. Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff.          In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read.",2,2,2,2,2
3375,2,"I think libraries shouldn't removed material from the shelves even thoug its offensive. The libraries should't removed offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic. For an example the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2. In some books its has some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that were stated by @CAPS4. Some @CAPS2 might take that offensive but other people from diffrent race or relegion might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesne't mean all of them are going to agree with it. People might have their own point of view, no one has there right of telling one person what they can or can't like.      If cenorship starts to occur in libraries or other in other communtiy places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offensded of their material. They might think that they are being told of what they can or can't read,listen,or believe in.That will occur a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simplier if library haves the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended of what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended of what one person says but who cares, not everyone is going to think or agree of what is being said. Its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves  and in your believes. Not everyone is right and perfect just be youselves",2,2,2,2,2
3379,2,"Dear @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @MONTH1 concerm;             I'm writing you to explain that @MONTH1 students are tired of students in their school not returning books to their schoollibrary. Many students have report due on a book that a fellow classmate didn't return. Many students either forget they have a book out or even past due. So it makes it hard upon the student who is trying to do a report. If the books, music, magazines and etc., are not return people should have to be punished more than just having to pay a overdue fee.     I have witnesses alot of students who didn't either want to turn in the book thr checked out. We the junior class at my high school had a term paper that we need books, newspaper, internet and magazines. Lucky, The senior class turned in all of their book, newspaper, internet, magazines and etc., that they used on their term papers, we the junior class were able to sucess on our term paper. But many juniors still havent reutrn the materials they have used.The teachers have threqten them with overdue fees and or have to pay for the losted material. I see that having to pay an overdue fee and or have to pay for the losted materials doesn't bother them.      Even though teachers makes them pay the future classes will have to struggle and go out and purchase books, magazines, and etc., The classes that have to take @CAPS4 @NUM1 next year and do their term paper @MONTH1 not be able to sucess. It is unfair they have to worry will have the materials they need for them to sucess and do their term paper.      I think if the schools took time out and got parnets involed. They would n't have as many students would didn't follow rules. students think that their teachers can't tell them what to so maybe if their parnets were involes they would follow directions and turn in their books, magazines and etc.,     In conclusion, If someone wants to take a book they should get alot of their personal infornmation as well as their school name.If people dont return their books their want be any thing left for other people to use.So i say everybody do have the right to use the books, music, movies magazine and etc. to their adventage. Just try to remember to return them for other students as well.",2,1,1,2,1
3383,2,"For many students it is hard to compose essay's in a public school's library. Aquiring the neccisary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. @PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent @MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they @MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment. Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, '@CAPS3 is written by the victors.' @CAPS4 it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world. Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist. It is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb",5,5,5,4,4
3386,2,"Have you ever imagined a @CAPS1 without movies or music to entertain you? A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently.     In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it.     Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts.     I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials.",5,5,5,5,5
3391,2,"'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magizine's and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelfing units?     Magazine's are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are @DATE1 of age. Library's will most often place the magazine's on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers. Most of  the content of the magazine's are pictures of half dressed women or men and explict lanuage on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so.     I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better @DATE1 sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing @CAPS2.V. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems ardous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the magestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn'@CAPS2 right. It shouldn'@CAPS2 even be allowed.     With electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 know half the songs that the children buy, expecially when they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 buy it at home. With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive lanuage or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can'@CAPS2. And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the avaliablity of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the aweful lanuage all together in songs. Because the lanuage that they use is not needed.     Although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul lanuage is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explict lanuage and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea. It might just start a revolution",3,3,3,3,3
3407,2,"Books are important in the life of human beings wheather they are for studies,entertainment, or any other use. On the other hand, are some books offensive to readers. If certain books are offensive should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether. With this being said, Should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Some reasons against this are you are taught to stay away from bad things, some people have different views of 'bad', and even if they are offensive they do not need to be removed.     Some materials are offensive to some people but not to others. This is the case in anything for example movies, books, and daily life. Some people @MONTH1 think the type of words used in a book make it bad, but to others that is what makes the book. For example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words. Another example is describing how horrible a person was killed, it is not enough to say he got stabbed and beat, you have to describe just how brutal it was to please some readers.       Another reason why books should not be removed is people are taught when to tell that something is offensive. If a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material. Also if a person rents a movie they know they aren't allowed to get an @CAPS1-rated movie then they should get another movie. People should know to not get a book read about the offensive stuff without stopping then go complain. If a person was concerned about a certain material they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not.     Even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed. That is only the opinion of sombody. If the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed. If material were removed because someone said it was offensive then ther would never be any more books. For the reason that anyone can be offended, so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad.      For those reasons materials should not be removed. What if everybody started saying things were offensive ther would not be any more books. People should not have the complete say in the removal of books. Otherwise people would complain just out of spite towards certain people's material. So do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.",4,4,4,4,3
3418,2,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,     I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say. @CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them. The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine.      The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7.',strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product.     Now a days, @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7'll be. If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 did @CAPS7. Why can't I?'. Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school.        @CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. Not something a little five-year-old needs to see. Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien.     Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal. @CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren.      Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win.      I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.      As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is. Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 online. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7. Although, once you owned @CAPS7, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7. That would be on the parents plate to deal with.      Another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @CAPS7's kinda like their second home, only @CAPS7's inside their brain. Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday. Once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty.      I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things. So, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion. Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up.                                   Thank You,                                   @PERSON2",4,4,4,4,4

Myself though i do not like reading I find it to be boring @CAPS2 somtimes tireing unless it is actually a good book.

Movies I like are all five of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movies, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4 The @PERSON4 and my all time favorite @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 And the new karoti kid. Music I listen to consist of @CAPS8-@CAPS9, @ORGANIZATION4, @PERSON2, @PERSON5, @LOCATION3, @CAPS10-@CAPS11, @CAPS12 @CAPS13, @ORGANIZATION5, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 they are all great singer song writers and do a great job at what they do @CAPS2 make millions off of it I mean come on people love music more then anything. there are movie music albums sold in the world the there are book and movies combind which I really think proves a big point when I say music is better. Serveys have been taken music wins everytime. So therefore this concludes my opinion on this subject and I hope I voiced it good enough to prove my point to people in the world that say books @CAPS2 movies are better because their not.",1,1,1,1,1

Just because a book @MONTH1 have certain views that can be offensive does not mean it should not be allowed on a shelf. A book should not be discriminated by what the contets @MONTH1 have source of a reader. Positive and negative books should all be allowed on shelve for any whom that have an intrested.          As for music and movies that could be place in the same catogoery can be reasonable. Its really not that neccasary to be place in a library because its a place known for peace and quite and relaxation. If music or movies become a hazard then it should not be welcome in the library. Positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand. It is understandable to have a little tone in the with some knowledge within the eyes in a book.      Magazine is another non neccasary object that is place in the library. A magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it. Not all magazine have something that can be use to educate. Most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe. Magazines should be removed from the library.                      The library should be an experience of a learning envirnment and only materials that will be a good help instead entertainment for pleasure. Remove a book from a shelf is like decrease from knowledge that could have been known. As to remove books should not be allowed no matter how or what the content of the book @MONTH1 be. As for music, movies, and magazines should be a limited for usuage in the library.",2,2,2,2,2

Because they can scar a kids mind forever, so in my opinion any books with thatstuff in the book should not be on the self for any public library. Also we should have more sensory in books with inaproprite speaking because it can give a person a change in thought.Also let me give you a example,lets say a little boy asks were the action books are, the libarien would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading this books an the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book an my big brother said it a good book too. And in my opinion that is all I need to say.Sincerly your customer @PERSON2.",1,1,1,1,2
3440,2,"Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case",3,3,3,4,3
3445,2,"I personally don't believe they should us censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone @MONTH1 thing that it is offensive because, thats just one persons opinion. What's one mens trash is another mens gold, what one person finds offensive could be sawt out by millions. Plus in todays world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has there own opinion and there own belief. Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at less one person who thinks something is offensive in someway, shape, or form. If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to exspress themselfs.    If cenorship was used everywhere schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kid would have nothing to involved. Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote. It's true as I have already stated if everything was cenored there be nothing left to be enjoyed.    Think about it this way would you like someone telling you that your not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset exspecially if they're a adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control peoples lives.",4,4,3,4,3
3446,2,"The quote that Katherine Paterson declairs a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in anothers point of view.     Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyones personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disguisting and cruel. I have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict.     During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that i loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things i loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rote and vanish forever.      I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taking off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you dont like the novel, then i assist you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?",3,4,3,4,3
3450,2,"While their are many books written out thier @MONTH1 offened many types of people thier are some that just need to be wipped off the face of the earth, those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. That is one of my favorite quotes and i don't use it lightly. Take from example 'The @ORGANIZATION1' the very book that gives instructions to build bombs, teaches you how to use firearms etc. this book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand like thier religion and how they look. This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach. Thats why i think this book needs to be taken of the shelves for good, thier was alos hate properganda in the books about how the @CAPS1 shouldn't be alive and that's disgusting i would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone.     One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than one other @PERSON1 the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to thier undeserved graves. He sent men, women, and childeren to his many death camps and work camps. One of those many childern was @PERSON2 who was in hiding from the gustappo or '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. Because of this monster the @CAPS7 lost one of the worlds greatest and most deappest writers for the @DATE1's. This book was filled with hate messages and how the @CAPS4 people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the 'supposed' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7.

All in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific Books",2,2,2,2,3
3453,2,"I enjoy reading very much so and I have read several books since I've been in highschool. Three of the best books I have read through my high school career were about drugs, rape, partying, and had innepropriate language in them.      Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong. We have  freedom of speech and press so why can't those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want.      People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that's wrong, if you don't like them then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It's just a book, it's not like it's actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books.      I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think their offensive, that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think their offensive.When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it. It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book. Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive",4,4,4,4,4
3454,2,"I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf. They are certain books, music, movies, magazines that people find quite offensive. There could be a few books that have some aweful material in it. The pictures in magazines, on cd cases or on movie/dvd cases would have stuff that people @MONTH1 find really offensive. I have never actually seen anything like that before, but it does happen in schools all aroung the world. People might not get what certain materials want you to do, but they @MONTH1 get offended and tell someone about it. They would most likely to tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material. Certain materials should be removed from the shelves.",2,2,2,3,3
3460,2,"As many would agree, censorship is a growing topic of concern throughout the world. I personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent. If one feels the content of music, a movie, or a book is questionable, he or she has the option of reading, listening, or watching.      Among many deabted materials, movies have ratings, just as music has 'bleeps'. Movies are rated '@CAPS1' for all audiences, '@CAPS2' standing for parental guidence, '@NUM1' for parental guidence for ages @NUM2 and older, and lastly '@CAPS3' meaning that anyone under the age of @NUM3 is either suggested or required to have an adult present during the viewing of the film. At home, the ratings are all based on the parent's preference. At the movie theatre, the restrictions become a sort of law. Anyone below the age of thirteen is not permitted to see a movie that is '@NUM1' or '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by an adult (anyone @NUM5 or older). Anyone who isn't @NUM3 or older @MONTH1 not enter a movie rated '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by someone @NUM7 or older. Depending on where you are, the restrictions @MONTH1 be more or less harsh. Ultimately, the rating system is intended to force parents to choose what is and isn't appropriate for their child.      As for music on the radio, all 'curse words' are 'bleeped' out. If a person wants to buy their own music, artists are required to make two of the same album, one with censors and one without. Thus creating a decision usually for the parents, usually assuming they are the ones to but the album or the music for their child.       When it comes to books, there are no ratings, just genres letting the reader know who the author's intended audience is. Types of genres include 'adult', 'young adult' and 'children' sections in libraries and book stores. Just like music and television, the final choice in the purchase is all dependent on the parents.    Even though many restrictions put in place, there are still some faults to the system. Obviously if you are @NUM2 or younger, you most likely won't have identification. This leaves the person working at the movie theatre the option to let in who they believe to be of age. Looks @MONTH1 be decieving. Buying music from the internet doesn't require any type of identification either. How can they prove your age? When purchasing a book, not many cashieers would stop a child and say, 'that's innappropriate for you'. Maybe kids of all ages should have identification. Although these are all underlying problems in the censorship system, it seems to all lead back to the parents.     Censorship is a huge topic of discussion for the parents of today's young and growing society, but in reality, if they have an issue with the content, they themselves will either rid of the material or prohibit the use and or puchase of it. All in all, it's about the parents and their personal preference",3,3,4,4,4
3464,2,"Do people have the right to limit freedom? Do people have the right to limit imagination? Do people have the right to limit self expression? Many people in today's world think so. Book  censorship is a big deal in the world today. Weather books deemed 'offensive' should be taken out of libraries or not is a serious issue. Censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech.     I believe people should not be able to censor books. Censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination. All through life people are urged to think outside of the box. We are told as kids that being unique and diffrent is a good thing. We are all told this and yet when writers express themselfs in books, the same people that told them to think outside of the box, want to censor their thoughts. By censoring books, we are telling the world that imagination is a bad thing.     Many people want to censor books so their children can not read 'offensive' matterial. They feel that by taking books they feel to be 'offensive' out of libraries, they can sheild their child from the bad things in the world. This is not the case. People @MONTH1 be able to censor books, but no one can censor life. Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without  books.      Book censorship limits knowledge. At the time it was written, The @CAPS1's of @PERSON1, was a very scandels book. Because of the laungauge this book used, many people thought it was trash. Many people wanted it to be censored. Today The @CAPS1's of @ORGANIZATION1 is a famous and classic book. In fact, I was required to read it for school. Regardless of the language this book used, it shows a part of @CAPS3 history. And to think, if people back then would have removed it form the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book, and I would never have the knowledge I gained from reading this book.     It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose. America was built on the idea of freedom. Under the constitution we are garentied freedom of speech. By taking books out of libraries, we are limiting our freedom of speech. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't read a book you want to read. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't write a book as you want to write it. If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts. Making writers do that, limits thier freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come?     Book censorship and censorship in gernal, is not a good thing; all it does is limit things. If we start censoring books, we are giving a messege to our children, that diffrent is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, how long will it be untill our other rights are limited? Where will it end? Before removing even the first book from the shelf, we need to ask ourselvees this, do we have the right to limit freedom",5,5,5,5,4
3470,2,"Censorship in Libraries.                                                                           Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries. @CAPS2 are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves.  Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, '@CAPS1.'  @CAPS2 is often a week where people read all of the books that have been @CAPS1 from school libraries.  I participate in this school wide challenge beacause I disagree with banning books.  Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons.     First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view.  How would you feel if you spent around @NUM1 years writing this story/movie for kids that got @CAPS1 in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves.  I don't think that many people would enjoy that.  I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal.  When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world. Including, newspapers, books, and magizines.  Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see.  I feel like when books or movies get @CAPS1 or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing.  The parents point of view makes things a lot worse.      Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he/she wants you to read with him.  You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate secne in the story.  You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story!  What do you do?             Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book.  Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere.  How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone?  I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong.  Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it.      When you take the book, movie or magizine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library.  This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story.  If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea.  It makes the @CAPS1 object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab intrest to.  If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie. @CAPS2 are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries.     My view on this topic was negitive and I support that fully.  If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story. Many different poeple come across this issue and @CAPS2 are many different views on the topic.  Next @CAPS1 book week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting @CAPS1.  I hope that you will too.",3,3,4,4,4
3472,2,"Books are a form of history, each telling a story from the past. in history we dont block any offensive events that take place so why should we removed any books that have offensive material in them. it would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools.          books are a very important learning tool in todays schools and there is somthing new in every book that a kid can learn from. so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing. and doing this on purpose would  be aginst everything that schools stand for.          there are many diffrent janras of books, but not everybody loves every jonra if a person only likes to read young adult books because it relates to there culture, wich most likely will have  offensive language and events play out. if you were to take this away from a youngadult in school; once more this person would be missing out on books because nows they are not intersted at any of the books in the libary.       if you can even think of just one instance that could strip a student away from a learning opertunity you shouldnt do it. but the fact is there any many reasons why you shouldnt remove any literture from libary shelves",3,3,3,3,2
3476,2,"Dear newspaper,     In my opinion I don't think that censorship in libraries should be on materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines and more materials. Censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems. I don't agree with the censorship in libraries on materials for many reasons. In my upcoming paragraphs, I will explain why I diagree with libraries having censorship on a lot of their materials.     Many libraries in the world @MONTH1 have censoring on their materials. I believe that libraries have alot of censoring on most of their materials due to the fact that they @MONTH1 have children under the age of eighteen constantly viewing a lot of explicent content. Libraries shouldn't censor their materials but in my opinion they also shouldn't let under age children check out any kind of material that is only ment to be viewed by adults. Also if computer access is offered to children, an adult superior visor should be near by to make sure that no explicent content is being viewed.     Censoring in libraries could resolve in many problems, such as, customers not getting all the information they need for a centain material, children not reading up to their abilities or standards, and also children not learning enough or getting information that they need for school. If all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers. Yes, most people @MONTH1 visit libraries for the wrong reasons but to other people, those wrong reasons @MONTH1 be the reason for them to gain more information.     Materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people. But what's found offensive to most people could be found useful to other people. If something is found offensive to one person I don't think it should be removed from the shelves. If books and or materials are removed from the shelves, that can hide so much useful information that people could gain.      In conclusion, I don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that many information could be lost. Censorship doesn't always mean that the material is bad, it can also mean that the material is just not appropreite to be viewed or read by that certain age group. If a library that I visit has censoring on most of their materials, I would convince the library staff to take the censoring off. Censoring is not always bad and it's not always good either but it can hide alot of information from us which is not good at all.",2,2,2,3,3
3483,2,"In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines, and music that people find offensive. Some find them more offensive than others. I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn't be removed from the shelf. I believe this because other people @MONTH1 be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent.     These resources are in the library for a reason.If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it. People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some @MONTH1 not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given; if it's not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else. Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things.     In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they @MONTH1 need these rescources to help out with a class or presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information because it was found offensive.     Lastly, all books make people more intelligent. Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better.We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books. Not only books but magazines and movies help as well. Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication.For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don't have a problem with speaking in front of people. This is due to their intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary.      So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these rescources offensive. Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now. Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them. In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being tooken off the shelves would not help anything; they can only help us out",5,5,4,5,5
3492,2,"In this life time we will all have our own oppinions about topics and problems in the world. There is a question that ponders in my mind. Is censorship in libraries a problem or a right? If i was a parent, I think I would be able to understand why I mite want to have a book removed from a shelf, but the thing is though, it is unconstitutional to do that. That is why in my oppinion censorship in libraries should not be aloud.      When I was twelve, one time at the library I was reading the back of a book, and my mom approached me and told me that book was a little too graphic for me to be reading. It was about the @CAPS1. Now that I am older, I realize why my mom wouldn't want me to be reading a book like that at that age. That is one reason I can understand why some one would want to have a book removed from a shelf, but they can not do that because, that book is there to remind us why we should never have another world war again. I also think that everyone has there right of an oppinion on why somthing should be, or not should be done.     One thing that I have obserbed, is that when kids read bad things, and look at bad things, it can really have a big impact on there life as what they do in the future, and there present. That reason it's self is a very good explanation on why I think that instead of censoring books, there should be some type of boundaries posted on what types of books should be read beyond a certain age, or if the child wants to read a certain type of book, the child must have a legal gurdian with them at that time.     With that being said, I have come up with, what I believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries. I think that any book that mite have somthing that is a little bit appropriate should be put into a section that is rated just like movies. If somthing has a little bit of inappropriate language such as cursing, these books should be put in a section for people over the age of thirteen just like a movie. Basically, the books will be put into sections depending on what they are rated just like a movie. If the book is rated @CAPS2, you must be over the age of seventeen to read it.     This idea could be a really good solution, that way no books would be removed, but also these books will be kept out of harms way of children. Honestly, if I was a parent I would not want my children to indulge in reading of books that talk about sex, violence, and vulger, but also it is my belief that we all have our own oppinion, and have the right to be able to read and see what we want.      On thing I think we all need to think about is things that have been done in the past that have had huge benifits on our country. Our four fathers, more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1. This document has amendments. These amendments state that we have the right to speak, have oppinions, and read what we want because, we should have the right to live a free life.               To remove books from the shelves is unconstitutional, and I don't know about you,  but I know that all the people that have gone against the constituotion have not found a great place in this world. My basic belief is that, why remove a book from a shelf, when we can impervise so everyone is happy? If the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution. There is an answer for this, books should not be burned they are master pieces. Cencorship can not continue in libraries or there won't be any books left.",4,3,3,4,3
3496,2,"Dear, Newspaper editor          I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library, I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library. Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude. It also came to my attention that magazines arn't the only form of crude murchandise on the selves of our local libraries. They are also littered with movies, books, graphic posters, along with, what i find to be explicit music. I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of the murchandise, but I would like to display a comprimise that could come into play.      What I believe to be crude, @MONTH1 for some be acceptable, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while the other is unphased. I believe that I have come up with a very simple comprimise, that would benefit me, as well as keep the murchandise avaiable. Now most, to all should know that there are children sections in most, if not all libraries. So I say this, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its own section, that way customers whom seek the material now know were to go to recieve it. This way, I believe would lower the uncomfortable-ness of going to our public library.      The benefits of this comprimise seem endless, to me. This way the children are left with a safe enviroment to pick out their books, and the adults that find it explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library. Though I am not trying to benefit those whom seek the material, I think it would. This way all of the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it.     I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family friendly enviroment, not only for children, but for those who wish to enjoy their library expierence.

Maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf. I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books. If @CAPS3 based on a true story and @CAPS3 offensive it should be heard anywise because @CAPS3 part of history. Everyone needs to hear it because @CAPS3 true. If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language. For movies children should only whach @CAPS2 rated movies and nothing else. For magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language. But I could read any book I wanted to. It was in a book @CAPS3 not like I could onder stand @CAPS1 that bad ward ment.I think @PERSON1 saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights. And then she states that their wont be any books left for us. I think that means every book is bad if shes saying @CAPS1 i think shes saying.Their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  on the shelfs. Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children. And no @CAPS1 their reading. To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs.",2,3,2,3,2
3502,2,"Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have there own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about. If the author choses to write something that you do not nessisarly agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material.     Everyone is intitled to there own opions. Theycan do and say what they want. Somethings those opions @MONTH1 have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want. As an author you provide a book to the public, If it gets that far. When a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like. I book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive. Someone else @MONTH1 not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material. When a movie is made and it is '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie. They do not stop playing it because someone @MONTH1 having different feelings about the movie.     If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it. Someome else @MONTH1 enjoy something that you do not. Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not. You can not always make everyone happy. If the book becomes a problem and it a majority amount of people that think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf. If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it. If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that. If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so, so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it?",4,4,3,3,4

Im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time.      Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was somethin that had to be done then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I aviode whatever it is. I rairly change my ways though. Some times that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't mad a mistake or two?      This is really hard for me to right about beacuse I don't care what other people think. So I really don't get offened. I do know some people the get offened easy though. I try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time. To me thats no fun, I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essa. I bet there would be a lot less droma to but I dont know.     If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offened you, just dont read it again. It might not offened the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you. After a wile you will forget about it. I guess if it really really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it.

I think that we should remove all of these bad things from the world to help the kids and childern become better people in the world.      There are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see. When people like great singers sing about drugs and other stuff kids think that it is cool to do drugs so they start to do them and then they cant stop! You want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does. We need to encourage our children to be great people but we cant with drugs and volience that goes on around them, but we can try to banned the bad books, movies, and music. We need more good things to influence our children. We dont want our chilren to look at magazines and see women that are really tiny and they think that they have to look like that to be popular. If your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them. I listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life.     These are all the reasons why be should banned these things from our children.

You dont want these things to happen to your kid so keep them away from it.",3,3,2,3,2
3530,2,"Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. Should censorship be allowed in libraries? Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I believe it should be allowed.     Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. Young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see. Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children. Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child @MONTH1 take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting.      I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. Children that are under the age of @NUM1 should not be watching movies that are rated @CAPS1-@NUM1. There is a reason the rating is what it is. Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material @MONTH1 be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. If it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your @NUM3 year old coming home cursing and fighting. My sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library.          Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. Maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials. Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library",5,4,4,4,4
3531,2,"One @MONTH1 walk into a library, look over at a magzine rack and think, '@CAPS1 is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?' In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries.      In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and @MONTH1 be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine.      When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated @NUM1, @CAPS2 or that is unrated, so @CAPS1 would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated '@CAPS2' or '@CAPS4' for mature.     In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out @CAPS5 magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother @MONTH1 not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that @MONTH1 open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting.     If libraries censored books better, then children and teens @MONTH1 not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I'@CAPS4 not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully",5,4,4,3,3
3537,2,"Censorship in Libraries               Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 are many books, magazines, and movies out @CAPS1 that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone. Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose. Also, content that is inappropriate for children @MONTH1 be fine for adults to read. It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf.      All people of @LOCATION2 have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free. People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone is different and this causes the interests of each person to be different, also. Libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests. Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries @MONTH1 be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality.     Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. @CAPS1 is content out @CAPS1 that children should not see; however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with. Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults @MONTH1 find it enjoyable and interesting. Libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment. @CAPS1 are many different types of books and music out @CAPS1 and censoring these would greatly limit the variety.      In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children. They choose what @CAPS1 child wears, where they live, and where they attend school. It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music. Each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child. If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it. However, another parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with it. The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent. Afterall, you cannot shelter children from everything.      Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions. It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom. Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from. It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf. As citizens of the @LOCATION1, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as indivuals. Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books life on the shelf for any of us.",3,3,3,3,3
3542,2,"I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are ment to inlighten, inform, and entertain the reads. If you find something offensive in the book, movie, or even the magazine doesn't mean the next person will. If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read, don't make the people who don't have a problem with what their reading or watching suffur. They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do!     There has been times when I've wanted a book, but the libaray won't get it because of the adult content in the book. Yet I was raised reading those book, so to me it wasn't adult content. The same goes with the movies, I was allowed to watch rated @CAPS1 movies when I was eight years old. Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's of for a child or adult, like @NUM1 to rated @CAPS1. The libaray has the same works, a child cannot rent a movie rated @CAPS1 without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater.     Parent who are worried about their childrens well being, shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves, because of things they find offensive. Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one, like some libraries bann 'The @CAPS4 of @PERSON1', because of the way the story is written. Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, whom didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book. If they had read the book they'd would have understood, it wasn't ment to be offensive, but a fictional story of @CAPS4.     I remember living in a town, with a lot of christin people, so the libraries only had christin books. When I went to the libraren and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down, because of the christin population. I told them 'I have as much rights too have those books on the shelve, as they have to have their books on the shelves.' I never got those books, but maybe someday they will look back on those requests and think of way they should have gotten them.     The reason I think censorship is wrong, is because no one should be able to tell people what they should read or watch. When they pay the same taxes everyone does to have those books and movies on the libraries shelves. If you have a problem with what your child watches and reads, than limit what your child reads and watches. Don't take away other people rights to read and watch what they want.",3,3,3,3,3
3543,2,"In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certin people.     If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group I would not get made, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others them some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. I would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read.     Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group, and should not be seen by kids. Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group.     So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again.",2,2,2,3,3
3547,2,"To who @CAPS3 @MONTH1 consern,         I belive that books,movies, and magazines should not beremoved from the shelfs of a library if they are found offensive. @CAPS2 books @MONTH1 seem offinsive to @CAPS2 people but to others there prospective is a lot different. I belive that if books or other things are found offinseive they should have  a speacial place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them. Books are very valuable to most people in the united states.      Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive. But is @CAPS3  really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write. Just because one person  reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call @CAPS3 offensive. I have a feeling that alot more people would feel the same way.      Along with movies,and etc. I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library. There are kids sections, @CAPS1 sections, And even a teenage section. I feel like parents now in days dont want thier children to learn about stuff early in life. But i still feel like if they did not want there kids reading @CAPS3 then dont let them.     If there ever was a need to really look at something and give @CAPS3 another chance this  would be the topic right here. Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized. So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offinsive. Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey, @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3.      As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive  from  libraries. I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographys. People really do enjoy alot of these books and even movies,or magazines. @CAPS3 would be really great if this could happen, @CAPS3 would make a lot of people happy and satisfide.",3,3,3,3,3
3548,2,"Do I believe that vertain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make alot of people happier.      The wants and needs of people varie from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another @MONTH1 hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want.     Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has postive influences. That's life though and not everyone has th same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well.     Opinons will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.",4,4,4,4,4
3555,2,"If you saw a book on the shelf of your library that took offense to you in some way or another how would you react? Would you simply pass the book by and go on searching for another, or would you be so taken by it that you demanded it be removed from the shelves immediately? Every school, public library,  movie theatre, magazine stand, and any form of media in this world will do or say one thing or another that someone is not going to like. It could be in a magazine in the do and don'ts section and you get slightly offended because you do something that is on the don't list or something about a specific race. Everyone, one time in their life, has been accidentally hurt by other peoples words and publishings in the world, but I do not think that is ever going to stop.     All forms of media are for learning and entertainment purposees. These things out there in the world are not for one specific group of people, they are for everyone. Every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person. Just because one person does not agree with which hairstyle is hot right now doesn't mean that they should take it out of their magazines for all of their viewers. To me, that is just ridicolous.      So, say you stumbled across a book about the @ORGANIZATION1 in the library and you are a person from negro descent. Would you get offended? Or, say you were watching a show that was talking about slavery a hundred years ago, would that anger you? If I were a person of negro descent it wouldn't make me mad at all, because it is just history, history that happened a long time ago that does not pertain to me. We could not toss those books out anyways because without those history books at school we couldn't learn about our history. History is important to everyone and if we didn't learn about it and they did toss those books out how would we prevent history from repeating itself?     When I was a young child my father used to hit my mother, so my mother takes offense to anything in the media that has to deal with abuse. I tried to have my mother watch a movie with me called '@CAPS1'. The movie is about a girl who is abused by her mother and has her father's babies and she finally gets out of it and betters her and her childrens lives. My mom said that she couldn't watch it with me because, 'it hit too close to home.'      Everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media. The media does not look at you as a whole, just as a population of people. When one person doesn't like something it doesn't mean it should be taken out or erased from history, it should just be rewritten or refilmed. You cannot control what everyone else says or does in books or movies, you have to just be in control of how you look upon it as. That is what I choose to do and I would say it is working out great.",5,5,5,5,5

Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay.     I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't. Also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things. Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them.      Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others. But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't. People have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either.      Well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves. I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it",2,2,2,2,3
3560,2,"Do I think offensive reading materials should be taken off the shelves in libraries? No, books should not be taken out of libraries. If students go to school and they are in high school they pretty much already know what is going on around the world. Teens do talk about their lives so pretty much @CAPS1. High and @CAPS2 students are going to hear. If the parents are sending their child to school and they don't want them to hear about it then don't send them to school! In school they will hear verbal arguments and see fights. If the parents don't want them to hear about it from other kids than they tell them, they explain it to them. One way or another they will find out. It can come from the parents, their friends, teachers anybody. Teens do not care if your child is watching when they are fighting; they are not worried about that at that time.     The saying 'one person ruins it all for everybody,' well thats because some teens need to grow up and act their age. If you can't act your age than you shouldn't be in the grade you are in. Kids and teens need to grow up if they can't read a book without being inmature about it than don't read it. If their parents let them watch movies that they think they are old enough to watch than don't take advantage of that.          Taking books out of the libraries will not change anything. Kids will still fight and rough house. Yeah some books are a little outragous, but not all books. To be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in. High schoolers should be able to control reading about sex, drugs, or drinking. If they are not responsible to read that than they shouldn't get that book anyway. Songs made today can get a little out of hand. If your child listens to that kind of music with all the bad words, talking about sex, drugs, alchol. Than parents all you got to do is take those songs away. Teens that are mature shouldn't get punished just because inmature can't watch a movie, listen to sond, read a book or a magazine. It's not fair to those people. People that act their age should be able to read, watch the movie, or anything just because they can handle the situation better. So don't punish everybody just because of some inmature kids that ruin it for everybody",4,4,4,3,3
3561,2,"Im writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries.     I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not. Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way. What one person might not like the next person might love. They only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material. Then maybe the library should consider removing the item. Thats why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch. It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive, its many things to choose from. How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because of another person didn't like it? They would be upset and disappointed about situation.     In conclusion, I disagree with the fact that certain materials should get removed off shelves if felt to be offense. I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts",4,3,3,3,4
3564,2,"There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compasion. But, other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, taking books, movies, magazine, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing.       In many cases censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age. In libraires, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying.      Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head. This @MONTH1 cause an effect on that child and they @MONTH1 start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing.      Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barly had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many of nightmares from the movies or books that she read.      Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personly been offened by some books. Although, censored books @MONTH1 have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs.      Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people  have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the iniscent minds of young childern",3,3,3,4,3
3568,2,"I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'      @CAPS1 of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They @MONTH1 find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict.     Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults.     Censorship is the same thing that @PERSON1 did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in @CAPS2 society. The citizens of @LOCATION1 have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great",5,5,4,5,5
3573,2,"In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it.  Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left.  Students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed.     Removing items from shelves removes history.  Our history books tell us stories of slavery and descrimination.  If someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again.  Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out.  If you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it.  Something that you @MONTH1 take as offensive @MONTH1 be something that inspires and encourages someone else.  Wether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someones opinion alone.    Think about it.  If you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion?  You have the right to be able to read,watch, or listen to whatever you want.  It should not be limited based on someone elses opinion.  It would cause much argument among people.  Some have different opinions then others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence.     There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them.  If items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left.  People read for enjoyment and knowledge.  They deserve to have a wide selction to choose from.     In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something.  If they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it.  There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation.  We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through.  We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them.  Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it.",3,4,3,3,5
3578,2,"Today in society there are many things people have different views on. They can be religion, race, or brought up in a different way. Today in libraries there are many books of all types. They can relate to all different kinds of people. If one book is discriminating against another indivual is this right? I think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons.       First off, no one is the same, what might be bad to someone else can be good to another person. If someone simply doesn't like the context of a book, movie, or even music ect. They don't have to read,watch,or listen to it. Since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be amazing thing to another person.     Second, this can be there for purpose. The @LOCATION2 wasn't always a equal place. If there are books that talk about the discrimination on other races I think it's simply showing history. If we didn't have history to look back on we wouldn't be able to see how @LOCATION1 has progressed. From slave states to all free states. I think it is important for material such as that to be left so it can looked on upon.     Third reason, is a library is suppose to consist of these different things such as books, movies, music ect. If we were to take everything out the libraries that comes off offensive it wouldn't be a place were you could find things that you wanted. It would probably be a boring place. If theres no variety in a library I don't see how it can be called a library. You can find whatever your looking for in a library whether its on how to do hair to the hitsory of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.     In conslusion, these reason make up why libraries should stay the way they are. One is because what might be offensive to a ivdivual might be different to someone else. Second, it would take a lot away from history. Thrid, it wouldn't make a library what it is today. These are ligetament resaons why it should be left alone",4,4,3,4,4
3584,2,"TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2      Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life.  The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. One offensive to a person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another.  I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community.     Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre.  The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended.  Maturity comes with understanding.            Books are sorted by genre.  Most, to all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre.  The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor.  When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration.  If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D. the author would not want to use grammar from the present day.  The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so.     From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution.  Maturity comes with understanding.  If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2 then the book corresponds with the age of that child.  This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community",3,3,3,4,3
3591,2,"Offensive or @CAPS1?     Who can truely say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truely offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive?     While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the @ORGANIZATION1 books by @PERSON1. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The @CAPS2' and nothing more. Make believe and imagination was @CAPS1 a suitable thing fpr their child to read. For many families, though the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should.      While my family loves the books and movies some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would @CAPS1 be interesting, and there would be no music.      If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would @CAPS1 have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 and mine is of @CAPS6, @CAPS7&@CAPS8, @CAPS9. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a @ORGANIZATION2. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look.      Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scences in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact.      People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is @CAPS1 one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of @LOCATION1",3,3,2,3,3
3593,2,"Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some? Why is it offensive and how is it offensive? What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and movies that are offensive to some of the people?     In my opinion there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons. Some reasons @MONTH1 include: the put down on races, comments in the book, how the author wrote it and who it was written towards.      Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use. Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personal.      Music can be offensive to some people becasue of the language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children @MONTH1 listen to it, and children nowadays say things they here from music and try to be like the person saying it.     Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated. A good movie would be @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today.      Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting ahold of things like that.      Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library. So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are ofensive to some people. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So therefore it's  not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it.",4,5,4,4,4
3594,2,"Censorship?  What is it?  Well from what i know cenorship is where you are blocked from certin things that you are not able to ever bring into the place that blocked it.  So the question is it wrong to censor something or not, i think that libraries should be able to censor certins things that people find offensive.  First reason why i think it is right that people should be able to censor things is becuase little childeren could be able to take at peek at what they shouldn't be looking at, when it comes to magazines and also movies.  Next reason why i think labraries should be able to cenor is because people can find centin things offensive just as music, for example like vulgar language can be listened to and aslo also naughty things can be watched in movies.  My last reasoning why i think it is fair that libraries are able censor things is beacuase some people like to read but in thier reading can be bad things that they find offensive and they can always find a way to take an item out from a labrary.  These are reasons why i think they should be able to censor books, music, movies, and also magazines.     My first reasoning in why i think it is fair that libraries are able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines is because little childeren could be able to look at things things they should not be able to take a peek at.  Thses things could be like pronogaphy, and also really grusome things in magazines and in movies.  If these things were in labraries they can possibly show other childeren, inwhich it would not be good.  This can be a problem beacuase parents can put the blame on the libraries by saying that the workers didn't do a good job at watching out for the children.  Also i think think they should be able to censor movies beacuse little childern shouls not be watching gursome movies at a young age.  This can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines.  Also labraries can censor music.      I also think libraries can censor music beacause in music these days there are very bad things that any body can find that is offensive.  Little childern can be listenig to vulgar lyrics that are in the songs and they could be repeating it to other people.   This can be bad in many ways because first of all they might not know what they are saying,  so if one day they say it to an adult, that adult can put the blame on the library owners.  Also they should be able to censor movies again beacuse naughty things can be shown in those movies that certin age levels should not be able to see.  These are ressons why libraries have a right to censor music and movies.   They aslo have right to censor books.      Books in they libraries are great but some books should not be able to be in a library, certin books such as books about faith and other religions.  And also about gursome items.  Some people can find books about religion and faith to be very offensive because some people @MONTH1 not see eye to eye about other religions.  And to minimize this problem libraries can take these books out so peolpe won't find it be offensive.   And also libraries should be censoring certin books about death because it can really get to a person and they can show other people that will find it very offensive.  So this is why i think libraries should be able to censor things.     In conclusion libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines, because in some books they can have religion problems and problems with death,  movies beacuse in some movies it can show pronography and gursome things that peopel should not be watching,  and they should be able to censor magazines and music beacuse in magazines childern could be looking at certin things they shouls not be looking at.  And they should be able to censor music beacuse peopel can be offended if they ever listen to vulgar language.  So in other words i do think libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines",3,3,3,3,3
3601,2,"Television, news, drama, life, and controversy. These are just a few of the things books are written about. Some subjects are considered to be vulgar and innappropriate for young audiences. Many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer, but is that really such a good thing? Books have been an important tool for students for a long time. However, not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences. Stories about knights and princesses are great for young people, but other stories about the darker sides of life are normally kept away from the hands of children. Books are censored for all sorts of reasons. Some of these reasons are frivelous and should not keep a book from reaching it's full potential. The truth is that there is a line that should not be crossed, and some books cross this line, and are banned. Great. However, some books do not 'cross the line' and are banned regardless. Honestly, careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves.     If a book is written with only minor obscenities by a recognized author, and it is banned, then the author faces no serious pressure as the banning will be well known and consumers will still purchase the book just for a chance to read it. However, if an author who is relatively unknown writes a well-put-together piece that contains a few spots where the author @MONTH1 have made a somewhat vulgar reference, and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble. This author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work @MONTH1 be recognized. Banning books is hindering authors everywhere from being able to make a name for themselves.     Books that are especially vulgar should definitely be banned. No child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults. Children should be protected from such material, and book banning provides this service. If a child has a burning desire to read a book, they can simply ask their parents to buy it for them, assuming the parents agree that filthy books should be okay for children to read.     If a book can provide good discussion in a classroom setting, and is mostly 'clean', then it should certainly be available for everyone. Just because a book contains a few areas where innappropriate references are made doesn't mean that students shouldn't be able to read the book. If the learning material a book offers 'outweighs' the negative effects the book @MONTH1 have on a student, then the book should be available for students to read. However, because one cannot effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects, this is a difficult statement to make.     Honestly, it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book. Many books should not be as available as others, but using a new system to find which books to limit would be too difficult, and keeping the current one would make more sense than any other alternatives. In the end, a system that caters to the most sheltering of parents is the best one.",3,3,4,4,4

He listeans to his friends talking about drinking alchol and how much fun is it. He thinks it sounds amazing to drink. He dosnt no something is bad about it or not. No one every told him. So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing. Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life. Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.' @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people.     How do you tell on someones maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature. But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature. Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing. Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.     Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.. @MONTH1 have inapropte things in them. Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles? @CAPS1 a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes. If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies. People could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other thing? Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio. But, when they here that word or read about something or watch. They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive.      Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we dont, its bound to repeat it self. Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was. No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust. Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea.      Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects. Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level. These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places",3,3,3,3,3
3610,2,"Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left.

When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My @CAPS1 did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and @CAPS1 was okay with that and things like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', and '@PERSON1'.      Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; @CAPS1 likes country, @CAPS7 likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my unlcle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it.      That just does to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others.

3616,2,"In this persuasive essay i'm going to write about why or why not offensive material should be banned from library shelfs, and there are a couple reasons that are going to help me do that. I think that we should'nt take anything off the shelfs in libraries.      My first main point why we should not take any material off the shelfs in libraries is that there are some material that people might find offensive that others do not and are getting affected by those who do want these material off the shelfs. I think that some of the movies and books that is taken off the shelfs should be material that some kids should experience that @MONTH1 help them in the future.     My second main point is that if we do take all of the offensive material off the shelfs there would only be movies and books like bambi and scooby-doo, because all the material that are in libraries are offensive to people in some ways different than others. I have not found a movie or book in any library yet that I have found offensive.      Also if we do, we might as well not even have a library, because there would only be about @NUM1 movies and books in the whole building, because of all of the offensive material that people could find in cd's, books, and movies.     People hear cuss words probably everyday, whether its at school or home. So all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them. I just think of every movie and book as just a movie and book. Scary movies are not real and some books too. There is sex and other inapropriate things in movies, but thats also why you have to be a certain age to even get the movies.      To summarize up what I was just talking about in the last couple paragraphs, I think that we should not take any thing off the shelfs in libraries, beacuse it will hurt others, and theres just no need in it",3,3,3,3,4
3619,2,"Thoughts of @CAPS1    I feel as though offensive literary pieces should be able to be taken from libraries. If a piece of @CAPS1 is particularly offensive; the piece should not be displayed. From my own experience, controversy is the reason that books are stricken from libraries. All of my experience, observations, and reading have told me one thing. That one thing being, pieces of @CAPS1 are taken away because of their offensiveness.     From the experience that I have had with books that cause controversy, I have noticed myself not liking the book. I believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries. Coming from someone who does not particularly like reading. I feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though I would not like to read any longer. All of my experiences seem to point to not reading books that cause distress or controversy.     Of all that I have observed, I have found similar things as my experiences. I have seen people, classmates in particular, that do not desire to read because they feel that a novel has offended them. Though my observations @MONTH1 seem one-sided. I truly have observed more lack of reading due to controversy than the increasing of reading due to controversy. All of my observations seem to point to supporting the revocation of 'banned books'.     The piece that I have noticed most prominent to this topic that I have read would most definetly be @CAPS2 @NUM1. In said novel society has outlawed all books. The story seems to heavily favor those who wish to read controversial novels, though we can take something from reading this book. The reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument, as people lived happily without controversial books. Granted not all people did, but that is because of certain variables. From stories, such as the three little pig and the big bad wolf, we can understand how poorly the concept of controversiality is drawn. For instance, I was mortified hearing that the first time. I have never had the interest of hearing it again, as I felt that the story is not politically correct.     Pieces of @CAPS1 are taken away because of their offensive properties. If someone has no interest in reading a book because of the thoughts maintained inside of the text; the book must be stripped from the public. As it would only make sense to try to keep the peace. I for one support the cause to remove books from public places due to controversiality.",3,3,3,3,4
3622,2,"If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' @CAPS1 you asked why you were not allowed the same answer was always givin, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again they would most likely have said, '@CAPS2 if I wanted you to know then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it?     Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things. How would it change things if those movies, @CAPS3's, or games had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them?  What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive?     I would also like for you to think about the child you @MONTH1 have or @MONTH1 plan to have, would you want your child to be subjected to such things as '@DATE1 The @NUM1' or '@CAPS9 and @CAPS10' as a @NUM2 year old? Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence? Then they would never see them and to some that @MONTH1 be what's right, and for those of you who think that I have some news for you, those kind of movies are still made today.  '@DATE1 The @NUM1' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that i could throw @CAPS6 you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language. They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies.  There are @CAPS11 movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them.     You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them. But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes.  What would there be left to watch?  If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch, @CAPS12 the @CAPS13 and @CAPS14-@CAPS15? Not only that, but what movies would you watch, if all movies with something offensive in them were removed then you wouldn't have anything left for yourself.  Every thing that you might like and/or think is funny in a film, but don't want your child to see is gone.     My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that @MONTH1 be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see.  Instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them, but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music. It's what I'm sure your parents did you, and I know it's what mine do to me, and guess what?  It has worked so far, so why should we change it?",5,5,5,5,4
3633,2,"In libraries there are certain materials on the shelves that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.I have seen some of these materials in with my own eyes. But Should libraries take them off the shelves because of this matter? Thats the question. Some might find it offensive and others @MONTH1 not. It all depends on the person. Libraries cant please everyone.      In my opinion libraries should not take these materials off the shelves, because a material that they take off the shelf could be a material that another person enjoys. Just because you dont take the material off the shelf doesn't mean that there aren't other solutions for those that think the materials should be tooken off the shelfs.     Some solutions to fix this problem could be to take these 'offensive materials' and put them on taller shelves or in a room by thereselves so that children or people who do not like the idea dont have to see these certain materials.Then 'people who find it offensive' and 'people who dont' both get a side in this matter and it solves the solution to the problem.      If this solution doesn't work there are many more. The librarie can take out the really offensive materials and replace them with others more suitable for all.      Overall I do not think libraries should take out these materials. Just try to make people on the offensive and nonoffensive side both happy then there will be no more conclusions as in this one.",3,3,2,3,2
3635,2,"Should materials in libraries be censored? No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad.     What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ? If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get.     I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there. and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library.     So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people.",3,2,2,3,3
3643,2,"When u go places there will alway be something that one won't like not everyone likes everything. A library has to be the worst place for people not liking things. Censorship in libraies is getting worse and worse everyday, it is in everything in books, movies, music, and magazines. Should we keep things like this on shelfs? Everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries.     On the shelfs is lots of things with bad laugauge naughty pictures. These books little kids can pull off a shelf and see things that there parents dont want them to see. Censorship is everywhere not just in libraries. The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad. If there is a need for things like this Then have a special store for things like this",1,1,1,2,1
3645,2,"I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things. For example in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me or other people too. Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images, videos or bad words that should not be use  for everybody to hear or see. You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music, I'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids. This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth, if you think something is being bad say it, and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else",2,2,2,3,3
3650,2,"There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out.  It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting.  The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.  If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public",4,5,5,4,4
3651,2,"The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already.  A few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is.  Those reason are That the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read.     The first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read.  If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it.  If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area.  Although, sometimes the child @MONTH1 stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice.  That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read.     The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship.  Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate.  Some people would say that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever.  Most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them.  Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree.     The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books.  The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others.  It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say '@CAPS2 I want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort.  The point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books.     Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree.  The children probably would not look at the innapropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child.",3,3,3,3,3
3664,2,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:     I am writing to you today concerning cencorship in libraries.  I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some @MONTH1 seem offensive and to others not at all.  However, I do have my own view point on the situation and I feel that @CAPS2 is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves.     Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do.  With the world the way @CAPS2 is now, violence can errupt from the simplest of things.  Putting books on public shelves for the public to read, can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions.  Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result.     My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books.  This will create a safe and happy envioronment for all who visit public libraries,and other public places.  @CAPS2 will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors.  Children follow in their parents' footsteps.  Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this postion.  When our children grow up, we want them to beahve in a responsible way.  Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior.     As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are resepectful, happy, and responsible. I want people to get along with each other.  I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in.  Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that.  Without offensive books for the public to read, will create a better environment for the people living today.",4,5,4,4,4
3672,2,"There are so many things these days that people find offending, in so many different places in magazins, books, movies, cell phones, on the internet,even some words in songs. Some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self.      A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this? I dont want them reading this! What if it messes up their childhood? Honestly parents if you dont want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them too these places where it is at? On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that its something they should not be ossiated with.     Also if  evryone took things off the self what they found unoppropiate then we wouldent have anything left to read, listen to, or watch. Alot of times one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person to no end. For example @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable, but @PERSON2 could find the very same the extreamly offending. It would lead to many arguments amoung or communites.     Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well, and would not be a good idea. If this were to happen then kids would grow up thinking that this is a esay world. This world is harsh and not easy at all times. Kids learn alot of this through the media. As long as we have postive role modles to exsplain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong, and they should not take part in it, then why would it need to be removed?      If people were able to do this then the communities would have alot more crime from anger, we would have nothing left to read watch or see, and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to exspect from the media. So now i ask you, what do you think",2,2,2,3,2
3673,2,"At my point of viwe i think if materials such as books is offensive to the reader the reader shuld just leve the book allown.Because other readers might just wont to read it.Same thing for music,movies,and magazines, or any thing else just because you fide some offensive it wont be right to take it away from @NUM1,ooo of more people.Also i think if some is offensive to more then one person it shuld not just not be taking away right then in there we as people shuld step up in have a vote or talk about it about the problem.I think it just wont be right for us or to the rest of the wrold and then look at how much work the author hade to put in i never wrot a book but i also know it's not easy to do.Heres a example me and my family want out to eat but we dent no were to eat at so every body was thinking about pizzy but my big brother dent wont to so we dent go out to eat that night because of one person dent wont to thats not fair now is it. So in my conclusino i dont think its wood be ringht to take some away because some body fund it offensive you just got to look at the rest of the wrold you just got to because it wont right  to the rest of us.",1,1,1,1,1
3674,2,"The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The @CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.",5,4,4,5,4
3675,2,"Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that sceen is inapropiate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books.     Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, @CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.     Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music.     Book tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books becuse of inapropiate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.     A lot of theings seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so stricked when it comes to movies, music, and books.",2,4,3,4,3
3676,2,"The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow.     At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose.     My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it.     Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives.     If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains.",5,5,5,5,5
3691,2,"Censorship seems like a great idea at first thought!  It allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them.  Consequently, censorship in libraries creates the possibilty for every book ever written to be removed from shelves around the world.  There are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship.  It creates objections due to differences in opinions and autors being completely and uterly offended.  Censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries.     People have different criteria when it comes to deciding a level of offensiveness.  For intsense, if a fifty-year-old @CAPS1 female read a violent book with some curse words and sexual content she might think that it was offensive.  Likewise, if a twenty-one-year-old, careless male read the exact same book he would probably enjoy its content.  This defference in opinion poses as a huge problem in allowing libraries to censor their selecion.  I feel that it would be unfair to remove books that some audiences would enjoy.     Instead of completely banning some texts, why not move them to another section of the library?  Libraries could take some time to separate the books into categories and the books that they feel are offensive could go into a separate section of the library.  This section could be as simple a separate shelf, or could go to the extreme of a separate room or area closed in by a curtain.  Either way, completely getting rid of books because of their content is a terrible idea.     Authors could potentially lose money from the action of censorship.  They put in numberous hours and a lot of effort to write books and novels.  Some spend years trying to perfect their masterpieces.  Magazines and movies provide the same amount of time, but they also aquire an unimagineable amount of money.  If these authors, directors, and producers have their specific product taken off of the shelves it would be offensive to them.  They could have a decrease in sales which would cause a decrease in money as well.  The idea is simply unfair.     Librarians have the right to display the content of which they choose, but making them remove products that they feel are fine is ridiculous.  I think that censorship is a terrible idea.  If anything should be banned from a library it should be censorship itself!",5,5,5,4,5
3696,2,"Everywhere one goes, something is being kept from them. It is either to keep them safe, pure, or happy. In the everyday world people who break the law are put into jails and prisons. Not only is it a punishment for them, but it is also to keep them away from other people. This is much like how our libraries are becoming. Books that have questionable content are being thrown out.     I do not believe that this should be done. Books are here to enlighten people and let them experience something they never would have been able to on their own. People should be able to choose what they @CAPS5 and if it offends them they can choose by theirselves to stop reading that book. Many times I have learned new things from books that @MONTH1 not have been appropriate for my age, but it taught me a valuable lesson. For example, I @CAPS5 a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations, she became pregnant and it ruined her life. From this, at the age of ten years old, I learned that I do not want that to happen to me, so I am abstaining from adult relations until I am married. Of course the libraries should be seperated into different categories such as: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 at Your Own @CAPS6. Also, the same with magazines and music. That way, a person could go to a specific section and know what to expect from there. This is much like the movie ratings, a mother can pick up a movie and see that it is rated @CAPS7 and know that it is exceptable for her nine-year old to watch, except possibly save for a few curse words, but a child hears that in their everyday life anyways, wether the parent knows it or not.      In conclusion, I believe that literature should not be censored from the people. However, it should be categorized so a person could have an idea of what age group it would be most appropriate for. People have the right to choose what books they @CAPS5 and what they @CAPS5 about. Everyone can learn a valuable lesson from any book, it just depends on how they interprate it.",3,3,3,4,3

There are children that know the words to alot of the rap songs out there. The parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not.     I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life. There are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above. I dont think that it is right though for young children to learn about these things. How would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are ? Or what alcohol is? I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves but that can only go to a certain extent. After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age.     In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even chose a different genre that doesnt use those such topcis as much. Country music for example is very peaceful to me. I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways. I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too. Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listne to. I will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version.     Magazines also have alot to do with why children are so 'street' smart these days. Magazines can put false information out so people will believe it. Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someones attention. It works most of the time and children also see that. They are young and nieve so they will do what they see someone else do. That includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them.     Another subject is the movies that are coming out in @DATE1 world. Movies can reveal whatever they want. Normally the movies that are inappropiate for children are rated @ORGANIZATION1 will find a way to see @DATE1 stuff. A child could be on the internet and something accidentally pops up. All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally.     These are my strong opinions on what we should do with todays society. We need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching. I know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch. Thank you for your time!",4,3,3,4,4
3703,2,"I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books, movies, music, magazines ect. People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff.      Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive.     For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life. In history @CAPS2 because he killed people. Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self. which is a saying I have heard many of times.          So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, edgucate, and entertain themselves by. Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people",2,2,2,2,2
3726,2,"Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well.     Books are essential part of life. They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books.     It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1.     Over all, books are a good thing. They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them.",3,3,3,3,4

NO, the reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me,they might not be offensive to other people. Im not saying things like that are offensive to me because there not. I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them. That excites me.     Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don'@CAPS1 need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up. I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn'@CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'. Well thats a gud question. Just put it up and dont complain because the writer didn'@CAPS1 know you were gonig to take it offensive or the wrong way. They were just writing a book.           It's not the writers fault. He or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book. When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive. DON'@CAPS1 because they exspecing there self's. So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad  beacause they took it offensive. Your going to ruin it for the other people that though the book was either a good book or an azsome book.     So now that we got that out of the way lets move on and get on with our life's.

3731,2,"There are many things in this world that childeren should not see and that poisen the minds of them and others whatever age they @MONTH1 be. The things people see these days can be bad and shouln't be seen by anybody of any age. These things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also.     The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them than, then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same thing. But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung?      Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad?

3736,2,"How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.? Well, as shown by studies, @CAPS1 ctizens @MONTH1 take what these items say more offensivley than what it @MONTH1 seem.  They @MONTH1 seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across @LOCATION1, but is it really true?          Due to all the diffrent races @LOCATION1 sees every single day, sometimes we @MONTH1 @CAPS2 be doing our best to accept their diffrent cultural backrounds in our modern day society.  I have noticed just by going to a pretty much all white school how most people judge other races other than their own, wheather it be making fun of what they wear or how they talk, etc.  Sometimes I wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way.  Taking this all into consideration, I think that wheather or @CAPS2 they are racial books, magazines, or movies they should @CAPS2 be removed from there distribution around the world.       I know that wheather or @CAPS2 that these books, movies, magazines, or music are racial they should still be able to be heard by those who want to hear it.  I think that there are some people out there, for example myself, who like to watch movies and read books about slavery, the holocaust, etc.  It's a part of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and I enjoy learning about it very much.  It @MONTH1 seem racial though to those who went through these hard times and these items which try to explain the pain these people went through @MONTH1 just seem like a joke towards them to make fun of all they went through, eventhough it is @CAPS2 meant that way at all.  I also understand that there are people who write books about mexican jokes, black jokes, etc. or even make comedy movies joking over diffent races.  These types of things I think should be taken OFF the shelves everywhere!  These are the types of things that I feel are what bother many different races and make fun of their cultural backround.       When it comes to music these days, it seems they always sing about love, being hurt physically and mentally, and so on.  I feel like music shouldn't really have an affect on diffrent races, unless it is purposley made for the reason of making fun of people.  I don't see where magazines can be harmful to a certain cultural backround.  The magazines I read about aka seventeen magazine seem to comment about how beautiful these people.     Overall, I think that making fun of diffrent races around the world is never going to get better if we never do anything to help it get better.  Eventhough all these diffrent items such as: movies, magazines, books and music @MONTH1 seem racial I think they should be left on the shelf of every library to let people watch and understand more about the @CAPS4 of our world, but if it is a truly written book, song, movie, or magazine article that is aimed to hurt someone of a diffent race, that should definatley be removed from every shelf around the world",2,3,3,3,3
3741,2,Censorship in Libraries     I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library,1,1,1,1,3
3743,2,"Dear Newspaper,     I don't think there should be censorship at all. Everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy. Just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldnt exist. Maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelfs for censory that alone would offend someone? It would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie.      There are many reasons why censory shouldnt be in libraries. My first reason is freedom of speech. People have the right to say or write whatever they believe. Just because it can offend someone doesnt mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend. Give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to.     Also if you use censorship then it's going to effect literature in a bad way. By using Censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves. Not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them. If no one can read the books, no one learns.     One more thing to take into consideration, is the authors money. Alot of times in the library if I see a book I really like, I'll go buy it. But taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them. The author's write these books so they can make a point and make money. If we take the books down, they dont make money and they dont make their intended point.     In conclution I think censory is overall a bad idea. One because of freedom of speech. Second is it could possibly drastically effect literature. Third is its taking away authors money and point of view. These are the important reasons I do not surrport censory.",4,4,4,4,4
3751,2,"Let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility. You are in a world of endless possiblities. To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes. You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure. Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking. Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon. Quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the hallway to a different section. You think to yourself how unecessary those images were, now scarred into your mind. In most libraries, you will find anything you are looking for that can be contained within the confines of a book. I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect.       Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals. This censorship is @CAPS1 narrowed down to just inappropriate images, but religious, political, and cultural innuendo as well. Censorship should be evident in all sections of the library. I do @CAPS1 think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well. I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there.     Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge. Most everyone has used, uses, or will use a library in their life. This includes children and families. Children do @CAPS1 need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries. I do @CAPS1 think the books should be removed from the shelves, but put somewhere else where a child could @CAPS1 find it. Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to. Something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that. This shows that it is @CAPS1 good for a child to see such offensive things. Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can @CAPS1 stumble upon it, is the best choice.     Another reason that I believe that the books should @CAPS1 be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject. Also, others have the right to express their opinions toward another's thoughts. Just because you find something offensive doesn't give you the right to take that away from someone. I think that if a person so desires such things and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that. Although, people who do @CAPS1 want to see that should also have the choice to have that somewhere where they will @CAPS1 come across it. This is why the books should @CAPS1 be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section.     In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to @CAPS1 remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material. Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or @CAPS1 to see certain material they might find offensive. In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it. More people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone.",6,6,5,6,5
3752,2,"No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive. I believe that poeple have the right to read what they want and so do authers have the right to wright what they want. One of the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 statements is @CAPS5 of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want.     People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies. If people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library. If everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library.     This brings up the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. ''@CAPS5 of speech'' meens that people have the right to wright what they want to. if others find it offensive, then don't reed it. Also @CAPS5 of expresion lets people do this to. If people wish to express themselves by reeding it then they have that right.     One of my personal experiences is that I love music, so do my two best friends. One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it. He found these bands I had never heard and I realy liked them. If someone found them ''offensive'' I would have never got to hear how good they were.      This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries. not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history. libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information,it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderfull peices of work someone worked real hard on to create.",5,4,4,4,4
3764,2,"In this article I am going to talk about the way libraries sensor their books. I am going to hit points on what I think about the subject. But also give what point of view I feel about the books that are on these shelves. Also on the way libraries should handle this matter by pre-sensoring the books on the shelves. I will try to give details on why it does not or if it has to be taken off the shelf.     I think that certain materials should not be a problem if the librarians can keep a closer eye on what their reading. But it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read. This can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading. But some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature type book. But you just can not for get about those books, you have to watch what they are reading.     Some ways that they handle this problem can get a little extreme. If you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read. You just can't do this because what if another persons wants that book and they can not have it. But what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books. This I think can help with the problem.     I feel that they could also pre-sensor these books. This will help explain things in a way they can understand it. Plus it can improve the way people feel about them books. But also they print two copies one for a more mature audiance and one for a younger one. If they do this it would make an improvement so younger kids can take this information lke a mature person does and say this is not real life.     In @CAPS1 conclusion I feel like I am nuatral about the subject. I think it is a bad thing to have them on the shelf in a library. But I feell it can be prevented in the way libraries run it. Just keep a closer eye the younger audiance. Also to try and pre-sensor them to make them more friendly to the younger audiance",2,3,2,3,3
3771,2,"Libaries everywhere might have a book or two that @MONTH1 be offensive to a reader. I haven't found a book offensive to my readings just yet. Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library. But some people are against it, like me. Its going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines,etc., from the library.     Music in the library is good because you can't find old music like in the @DATE1's in a music store. If someone finds music offensive in the libary it might be because they don't know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through. Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music. I'm sure there's a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from. Maybe then they wouldn't be so offeneded.     Magaizines in the library are really for people who love the media. There are so many magaizines that have interesting facts about what happen or what's going to happen. For example @ORGANIZATION1 has all the newest event or something big that happend, just in that one @ORGANIZATION1. Then there's advertisments, how would people get money if they didn't put there adverstisment in a @ORGANIZATION1 so people could buy there product. If not nobody would buy the products.     Movies in the library are for teachers to show students. Half the stuff in the libary, you can find at blockbuster or walmart. It's because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual with the movie. So they read books.     Overall I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and don't change they way the library is doing things. Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offeneded by already. So its already too late for that. But its going to take more than one person to be aganist it. So that's my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library",4,4,4,4,4
3776,2,"Without books we all would not know what we know now.Its just like saying without a heart your body will still function. Books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything. Personally books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not. Books help you get a better understanding of many things someone else @MONTH1 not know,and or understand.The same thing goes for musis, movies, and magazines.      I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person. Also someone else is thinking different then they are. Books are another way of learning as well, they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. They also help you get a better meaning of alot of things. I am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem, but there are some movies, music,and magazines. But some tell you what age it is suitable for. For movies they tell you things like '@NUM1, @CAPS1' and other things like that. Also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it. Magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child.     Everything is not all bad, it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. You can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some. You have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and or do. Just to better themselves as a individual. People are so quick to judge the next but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help and that just because your life or whatever @MONTH1 seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone elses can't change.Those things are there for a reason if you dont like it then try a better way to get away from it.     Without those things in our life I really can see this world falling apart. We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about so just try to  picture all that being taken away. Its not a pretty site, accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability. They all are there for a reason.",3,3,2,3,3
3779,2,No i dont hink that should happen that would be stupid and im sure alot of people will disagree with it. one reason is because adults like all of that stuff.     And if they were doing this because kids keep geeting into them. then just get a door that says @NUM1 and older and put cameras up. If kids parents complain then at lest you can say that its all in one room and no kids aloud.     this shoudnt be a big deal if your a kid you are going to have to be round all the time when you grow up. So you might as well get used to it. it is a big deal if your cursing all the time but most kids know better and know not to do bad stuff. when i was growing up i was around all that stuff and i think i turned out allright,1,1,1,2,1
3782,2,"People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into.      If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear.     Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it.     We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'@CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can.",3,3,4,4,3
3784,2,"In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.     Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.     The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began.     Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.     Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where",6,5,6,5,5

3787,2,I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults. I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to.     I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d. or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book.     Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly.     If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission. I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were @NUM1 years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit.,3,3,3,3,3
3790,2,"I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others. However, if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it.      So what i'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book  is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existant.      I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read. I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable.      The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be. So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem.",4,3,4,4,4
3798,2,"How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone, kept hearing bad words from a song that was in the library! Would you really want that for your child? Thought a library was supposed to be a learning center, didnt know it was a bad place to be. People have their own opinions in everything! A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to people. Please help try and help us stop this! We don't want it getting to our kids, like it has to others!     Some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them! One thing that catches them is the beat, it just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is beacuse their friends like it also! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be. When people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer, book writer, or actor. When that idol grows older it most likely isnt going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had @DATE1, they change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in. When that happens people loose than interste in them unless they think its cool! It all just depends on the person! Some people thrive off of these things!     Libraries are supposed to be for all ages! If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents thats just putting down the library and they aren't going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will loose a lot of their buisness. Young kids these days are being expossed to a lot of more things that they should'nt be! What little kids already know is sickning! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of @DATE1! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it's right! Kid's are growing up way to fast because of the things that they know!     Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifty's, even the eighty's, yeah they werent the best, but its gotten a little extreme theses days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and, magazine articles/picture. People shoud have id's that they have to have to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but its worth a try!      The world is'nt a happy place anymore! It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in @CAPS1 or if they don't is another example of this! It always affects ther actions and thought! People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things; seeing bad picture, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! dont be a follower because it's not going ti get you anywhere in life! Everything counts!",4,3,4,4,4
3805,2,"Censorship in libraries!Do you believe that certianmaterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?NO!, I do not think they should be removed. I believe everyone is intitled to there own opinion, @CAPS1 if something is offensiv eto one person @CAPS2 @MONTH1 not be to another. No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about somethings thats why there is a variety of books, music, movies etc. If you take out the 'offensive' things, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 cause offense to another.People just need to stop being sefish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests",3,2,3,3,2
3808,2,"I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries. I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading. I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeeing other peoples point of views on certain subjects. Though books this material can be called offensive, to certain people this is there culture and how they live.    What would happen if every book that was considered offinsive was actually removed for book shelves? Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial. The eye-opening world of these books is amazing. The fact that I can read about other peoples life, and their everyday struggle is astounding to me. If we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion, then our world would be a mess.     Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then what is left to read. I want to read something that is going to grab my attention, and make me want to keep reading. I do not think that i would have that type of experience if these books were removed.",3,3,3,3,3
3809,2,"I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise. Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intollerance. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. Censorship stops these things from occuring.     If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period. Not all children and teens are drawn to reading. If there is a book that a reluctent reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? Because @CAPS11 or she finds it offensive? Because @CAPS11 or she does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship.      Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @PERSON3. To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were censored because of the racist language. @CAPS12 language helps to set the time period in the novels. Also, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS9 is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in @LOCATION1. The main antagonist is an ignorant, rascist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villian of the story.     Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. Preventing a child from seeing a rated @CAPS10 movie or reading a letter to @ORGANIZATION3 is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well.     If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then @CAPS11 or she will not be his or her own person. Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood. They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them. @PERSON2 said, '@CAPS11 who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.' @CAPS12 is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. Censorship can mold people, not for the better. People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently.     These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. Anyone is capable of possessing them.      Censorship cannot be seen as the norm. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow.That is the purpose of the institution of education. Therfore, censorship should not even be considered. Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries",6,5,6,6,5
3813,2,"Should we remove offensive items or materials from a public library? My belief is no because many people in today's society are pretty offensive themselves and the books are meant to show the life of fiction or fact and when you do censor something the other person will try his or her best to try and find an uncensored version of the same material.      Art books are another thing that should not be censored because the artist is not trying to be perverse or offensive he or she is just trying to show his vision of art in the form he or she feels people would find artistic.  Censorship is important in some ways but you also have to have an opened mind because someone who finds something offensive might not feel that way later on in their life.      So my belief is don't censor something because it might offend some, because there are many who probably don't take offense to it be it books,music,videos,video games,writing,or movies.      We are all going to have a democracy over if something should or shouldn't be appropriate.     So what are your thoughts censor a book because of it's content or leave it and let the people decide?      My thoughts would be censorship is moral but you also have to think it would be immoral to take a book away from a reader that might find this book interesting.      So please don't censor books from our public library, we need books that have facts or fiction in them but also have a great story in it's words.          My other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended.",2,3,3,3,3
3814,2,I think that that if there is a book in the libraries that is hurmful. Then you should  have to be at least @NUM1 years of age to check it out. The reason why i say @NUM1 is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong AND you can handle it if is wrong. I mean if you know its wrong then dont read it no one is maken you read it.     It would be differnt if some one waz but no one is.Some people like to read differnt kinds of books just because its not right and hurts you dont mean it hurts ever one it @MONTH1 make it helpfull to some one esle and if its tgaken out then there wont be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read. BECAUSE ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it.     If you have have a problem with that you can contact me at @NUM3 ask for @PERSON1 and we can talk bout it and mabe you @MONTH1 be about to change my mind or after you read this you make think the same way as i do.      The reason i feel thinks way is because like i said before there is a part in ever book that will hurt some one so you should have to be @NUM1 to check out surten books.If ur getting hurt by a bunch of books then i would sugest you to stop readen because a book is a book not somthing to hurt you.There is so many people in the world that is into books and resourcen bout stuff.     What i do not agree with is that kids getting out of class going to the library playing games and putting puzzels togther that is the problem  i got.I mean yeah people do go in there and do work witch is find BUT some say that they have work and they dont.They just want to get out of class and not do work. People go in there and play games and when people need on the cumputer there is no were to go because of kids playing games.          But as the book part in the library i dont have a problem with that  thats what i got to say bout books hurting people is dont read them other people  like them being there for them.,2,2,2,2,2

3820,2,"Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no.     Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things. It's almost like when people were segragted by race. The segragation led to fights between the people. How would you feel if segragation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things. That is probabally how some people feel when they get offended by the media.     Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong?     In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are ups and downs either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exsist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended. The last thing we need in our society is fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no.",4,4,4,4,4
3822,2,"Libraries are often known for protecting our children and keeping an education atmosphere, however, you would be suprised the content our children @MONTH1 find in such a seemingly friendly place. With a simple library card, children could check out a   boat-load of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn. But nobody can be looking over thier child's shoulders all the time. The answer to this problem is strict censorship.     Books are big, powerful, and a vast amount of information. Even though most parents believe publishing companies would intend on not letting children reading books that can be easily misunderstood, the truth is it's up to the library wether or not a book can be checked out. Most of the time, only adults can understand what the charaters in a book are going through. This @MONTH1 be because of the adult's extensively more experiences throughout their own life. Another comon belief is that seperating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem. The fact is, even if an adult checks a type of media from the older selection, this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home. The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive, easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands.      Libraries are great for research or school projects, but books and magazines that are inapropriate should never end up in the place built for an education experience for your kids. Censorship has to be inforced to help keep and maintain our libraries educational atmospher and keeping our children safe from offensive material",3,3,4,4,4
3827,2,"A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. @CAPS1 isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the are in the library that contains the offensive materials.      In my own personal opinion, @CAPS1 doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent @CAPS1 or read @CAPS1. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them.     Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials. The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them.      Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do @CAPS1, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see.        If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents.      If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business. So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials. So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules.",4,4,3,4,3
3835,2,"I believe that everyone should be free to read, listen or watch what they choose to. Anything publically exposed is goin to be seen anyhow. I think it shall be up to that person if they want to read something to mature or @ORGANIZATION1 for themself. If it is a child i think the parent shall be in charge of that decision not the libarian.     Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment. People read @ORGANIZATION1 material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment. Everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair. If it is public that mean it should be released under certin circomstances or age, and maturity. Regaurdless of in a book or magazine everything that you dont want people to see will always show up somewere else, such as the tv or the internet.     The public library is were people go to get books to larn more about something so if u yake that book off the shelve someone might miss out on on  education about somthing. I wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read, and it might be a good thing that child gets that book so that they have knowledge about somethings that are out there. If its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it.        If its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent. anything publically exposed in a book, magazine or movie will be shown on the internet or tv so children will see what they want  rather elders' agree to it or not.

I dont think it would be far to others.     I'm going to give you three reasons why you shouldn't let people just remove stuff like that off of shelves. @CAPS1 first reason is that, what if you had a child and wanted he or she to see the same movie or book you did when you were little? But they took it off the shelves. That would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they cant. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'     @CAPS1 seceond reason is, what if you and a wife or husband had a favorite song, but they took it off the shelves? That would be devistating, it would just break your heart. Well I know it would me if it was are wedding song.      The last reason and @CAPS1 favorite reason is, you just have your own opion. Everyone has thier own opion, if you dont want to see them or look at them just dont do it. It's as easy as that, just try to ignor it. It's really not your problem to worry about.     Those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 if we let this happen everyone will take avanege of it. That is why I am @CAPS2 no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves",3,4,3,3,3
3841,2,"Books movies and music should not be removed from the shelves.

There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world. They love to pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read. Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lyes with the parents.           If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book.      if we  had all of this then there would not be any more problems. it would be a nice controled libaray. so in conclustion this is the way to go. this is the futur of tommorw",2,2,2,2,2
3842,2,"Lets think in todays known world the childern and teens have access to pretty much everything.     If you ask a teenager this same question should this stuff be tooken off the shelves. They might say no. If ask an adult how ever they are most likely going to say yes. The music that surrond young adults and childern isn't the best. Go ahead and listen you will be amazed. If they have access to it then they are going to take it and borrow it.      I feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off. Now thats just my opinion. Even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff. I say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this stuff. @CAPS1 you think about it they have so many rights that they shouldn't have.      If there is anything offensive then it should be tooken off the shelves. They should be replaced with educational things. Lets go back to where it all began back @CAPS1 everytbing started to come out. Did you have most of this stuff growing up? You probably didn't. But now you can find anything almost anywhere. Which is kind of sad if you ask me. Magazines however are starting to bcome more like movies and music. Mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show.      If you look at atheltes it doesn't matter who it is they get in trouble for things they shouldn't of said. @CAPS1 they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff. That right there will help out educatiion and what not. You can become a more responible adult by showing them whats right and whats wrong. Starting with what they listen to or what they watch. I'm not allowed to watch current things and yet I do anyway. Thats because my parents aren't giving me enough discipline and they didn't @CAPS1 I was little.      If you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want the odds they might not do good in school. One way you can help out is by hanging out with the chiold or childern. Even teens. Even though the don't want you too. Talk to them make conversatuions teach them right from wrong, @CAPS1 you teach a child right from wrong the outlook on school will be better",3,2,3,3,3
3843,2,"When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' @CAPS1 would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You would be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library.     A little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adualt section and they could see some things you would not want them to see. The romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing. A child could easily see that and not know what it ment but they would have theat image in there head for a very long time.Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns.      Its not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone. A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender. A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable. An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even acohole.     The magazines always have girls half clothed, even in seventeen magazine. The car magazines of girls modeling infront of the cars to make them look better or irristable. You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding. You could have jsut wanted to look at if because of the babies you or your child do not want to see a mom breast feeding.     The library is a very resourcful place and you can get very good information about things there. They have some bad parts about them too. I think they music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place. Same with the magazines, movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library. They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room. They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in.     I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone. I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them.",4,4,4,4,4
3849,2,"Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen. Now, more then ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now.         One reason to have a censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derrogitory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that. It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more then likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others.     If the goverment provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our goverment doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our goverment for support and answers. How would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country.Which would cause many more problems then needed. It would be a easier thing just to censor our libraries.     If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something. Rather than, lead them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things,  I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for.     When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex postitions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occuring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely.",3,3,3,4,3
3850,2,"There is alot of different thing that can offensive to all sorts of  people . so if we started taking thing off tv or out of book ,and magazines we would be always takeing stuff out. if it to graphic for kids put it in the adults area. would censorship be the awnser to take out  stuff no. we need to be more aware of where ur children are an there would be less probblem.     If we made the change the age limited on movie we might be even better off . If parent were to watch the movie then the parent would be able to tell them what ok an what not. we need to put more true history stuff in them an make them where you want to watch them we could be teaching kids more stuff so they know.the music should be censorship some what like with rap. there is alot of rap music that should be cleaned up so little kid dont hear it.      There might even be a better way to controll this stuff so little kids cant get a hold of it. We can have teacher help tell the kids an let them no that it not right for them to watch that. we also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on tv. There are some that need to be clean up. There are also lot of different in what people want. Then there some that dont care about it to. Maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to do it",2,2,2,2,2
3853,2,"Censorship          @CAPS1 was the last time someone told you what you could, and couldn't do? Especially if it was somthing you didn't want to do. How'd that make you feel? You probably didn't want to do it did you. Censorship is somewhat the same way.     The other day, my friends and i wanted to go see a new movie that just came out. We weren't aloud to see it though. You know why? Due to censorship, we weren't old enough to be able to see this movie. So, now the only way we'll be able to see this movie is if our parents go with us. Have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends? Doesn't go so well does it. Censorship violates freedom of being different. You can't listen to music, watch movies, or even read certain books, unless your of a certain age. That's not fair. Censorship is like a modern day @CAPS2. Tells you what you can and can't do, how you can dress, and what to say. Everybody would be the same then. How did @CAPS2 do with his idea, he failed miserably. How do you think the @CAPS4 victims felt, they were punished for believing, or doing something different. They weren't hurting anybody, they just wanted to live they're lives a diffent way.      Thats what censorships doing, classifying people in to certain groups. telling them what they can and can't see, do, or listen to. Thats what makes the world different, people that are different. Dont't make everyone be the same.",2,2,3,2,3
3856,2,"The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it.      Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it.        Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them. I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that.     There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate.   Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others  and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go.",3,3,3,4,4
3862,2,"Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict @CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature.      Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area.      Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives.      A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read",5,4,4,4,4
3863,2,"I believe everyone has the right to voice there own oppinion on life. If we censor ones books, music, or movies because they are inapropriate, it would be like silencing an oppinion that stands out among the others. If we silence the author and there story or song how will we be able to view life in another persons view?     In the @ORGANIZATION1 we have the freedom of speech and press. these amendments make it so that otheres can voice an oppinion with out being shot down. Although we have the amendments there are still restrictions on what we are aloud to publish. Say we found a diary writen by @PERSON1? Are we aloud to view his deepest darkest thoughts? or Are we going to say that it is too dark and depressing for the average person's eyes. His ideas are different, does that mean we shouldn't show them? no we should show them, we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life.     I believe that no matter whos ideas it is, if aloud by the author, should be aloud to be read and comprehend in our own way.     If one wishes to learn about how to murder in a @CAPS1 then i think they should be aloud to do so. The reason why; The @CAPS1 is becoming absolete, the technology era is officially here. There is not a thing we can't find in @CAPS1 that can't be found online.      Although the @CAPS1 is a government run facility, many people will go elsewhere to find the materials wanted to view the censored media. It is true that if we allowed 'censored' material into a @CAPS1 a child could find it. But like the internet you can block things from those kids.     All voices need to be heard, even if it is racist, sexist, biest, or just insane. these are ways to view the persepective or the reason behind hate and war. if we can learn from other mind sets through books, music, movies and movies, then i think we should be aloud to.     Nothing should be blocked from the public. Every one has the right to voice there own oppinion through there own way.",3,2,3,3,3
3864,2,"KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF!     I think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library. If we did that then there wouldn't be any books left. The only thing we should be worried about is the rated @CAPS2 movies. Yeah those can be taken out of the library. If one book is offensive to someone, then dont get it, but someone else might like that book.      For example, an older woman is looking through this magazine, and she sees this teenage woman taking drugs, or being half naked. Although the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip. We shouldn't get rid of any books because then we would only be down to one genre. There wouldn't be any categories left in the library.      A good idea is to separate the books, put the ones that seem offensive in the back. keep the childrens books away from the big mystery horror books. Another example is this. A student goes to the library to work on a history report over slavory, but there isn't any books on slavory because somebody thought it was offensive against african americans.      I understand that there is reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of some sexual content. Children do not need to be around those kinds of books. Or some books being taken out because of religious belifs. like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil, or something.     The movie situation i understand. I wouldn't want my little daughter walking up and grabbing something that has a sex scene, or drug content in it. You can take those off the shelf, but wait, right there is another example of why it shouldn't get taken off the shelf. Just because i want it off the shelf doesn't mean everybody wants it off the shelf. Then the libraries movie business would be over.      To sum everything up, nobody should choose what should be in the library and what shouldn't. Personally i think that there should be a variety in the library. If not everybody would get bored of the same books. Over and over. KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF",4,3,4,4,3
3865,2,"Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?",3,3,3,3,4
3878,2,"There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book. There will always be many more books there to look at. If there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person than bad books.     If other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves. It @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book. Some people go to the library just to see them kind of books. Certain people like certain types of books, maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in. The book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it. If anything the reader might even like the book and check it out.     The books are there for entertainment. Thats why they have so much different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though.      Books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one persons opinion. When  all they have to do is do not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember they are there for the readers entertainment.",3,2,2,3,3
3898,2,"Older authors love to write grusome stories about their pasts, whether it's fiction or nonfiction. Sometimes those books can get into the wrong hands and end up in the trash or burned. Other times parents get angry at what they're children are doing and saying, and they normally blame television or other kids at school. Parents don't always look at the big picture.      Any child at anytime can walk right into their school or public library and pick up an inappropriate magazine,book, or movie, but parents don't usually catch on until it's too late. There are all kinds of books out there and no two books are the same. Nobody can tell a book is going to be inappropriate just by looking at the front cover. Even though books are meant to be read, it doesn't mean they should be read by all age groups.      No book at any point in time should be completely removed from a library, that's just not right. No matter how graphic, perverted, or inapproriate a book can get, it should never be thrown away. Those certain books are written for people with those kinds of interests. Even books about drugs should be allowed to be read, some children or adults could be interested in what they really do do to your body and mind, and they'd rather read a book about it rather than trying it themselves. Books about murder should also be allowed to be read, but not by children under twelve. If people in libraries would just start putting books in organized age groups then there probably wouldn't be any problems.      The author should never be blamed for something they wrote. It's their own personal thoughts and feelings and most of all it's their story. It's how they wanted it to be written and nobody should get mad over that. The rule should apply for magazines, music, and movies. Those people wrote the books, movies, magazines, and music so it should be expressed the way they wanted it to be. Even if the authors themselves thought their own writing was too bad for a child to read, or hear they would make it clear by putting something like, 'not for children under the age of twelve or whatever age they recommend.'     If adults are really getting mad about this then they need to look back at the kinds of things they were doing, saying, or reading and maybe it would change their outlook a little on movies, magazines, music, and books.",4,3,4,4,3
3904,2,"Many people in the @LOCATION1 read. Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.      Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears.      If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon?      Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed.     For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction",5,5,5,5,5
3912,2,"No criteria such as books, @CAPS1's, magazines, etc. should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. The @LOCATION1 is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine, you don't have to read it.     When people get all upset over a book or movie they saw it really drives me crazy, simply because you don't have to go see that movie, or go read that book. Different people find different things offensive, this can be because of race, gender, ethnicity, etc. So we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive. Some people think it is offensive that proffessional athletes get paid @MONEY1 for playing a game, when there are homeless people living on the street. Never the less the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is the most watched event in the world when it comes on. Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good. Another example is racial jokes, some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive. This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes.      Just as Katherine Paterson said, no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive. People do not find the same things offensive, so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue. If you find something offensive then just dont pursue it. Almost every single book in the worls has something in it that someone, somewhere finds offensive. If we took all of these books off the shelves, there would be nothing left to read. This is a free country, which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not. So instead choosing to eliminate books from the library, just dont read them, because maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do, and they might like to read that book.",4,3,3,4,4
3930,2,"To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be?     I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There @MONTH1 be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing.     Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library.      No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice.     Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good",4,3,3,4,3
3932,2,"Censorship in libraries is almost a primitve if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs paralell with censorship in libraries.     A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, fealing no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author?     There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out.      Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categoriazation goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 ailse of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library. Problem @CAPS8. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it.     You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore",5,5,5,5,5
3937,2,"Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.     There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong.",6,6,6,6,6
3939,2,"There are many inapropriate types of intertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate.     With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to. Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive. Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a persons life.     With censoring there would be no diverstiy. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small.     I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society.     I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys. It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society",2,2,3,3,2
3944,2,"Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these procautions?     In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch @CAPS1.V. or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, @CAPS2, and videogames.     I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for.     When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it.     Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don'@CAPS1 care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library.",3,3,3,3,3
3947,2,"Know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries.  Well ok then I will you my not like what I have to say but I really dont care @CAPS1 if it was up to your dam goverment to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do. Theyd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldent learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs.      Now the way I see it is that we have every rite to read any book we please when we whant to read it. now if we dont want to read a book then we dont have to read it. but we as a people and they as a goverment do not have the rite to take your books out of the libraries. Now we as a people can press any thing we want @CAPS1 no matter what they as in the goverment thinks it is the people who run the stat not the dam goverment.     My point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our histoy. Books teach us about what wrong and what is rite. Books are here to give sceary story by a camp fire they are here to give kids a bed time story.  If we take thos books off our shelves you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait @CAPS1 the next one will be worse than this one i promise you that.      Now it is our rite to save our books, @CAPS1 if we do not then us as @CAPS3 will be lost. For without book our passed is lost, our fock tales are forgoten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without there storys.      Now come guy as a all pull it together. If you see a book on the shevles and you think its offences then by @CAPS4 put the dam thing down and walk away from it dont complane about it. No one told you that you had to read it. So don't ruine it for everyone just @CAPS1 eather you dont belive in @CAPS4 and you think that the bibles not rite then dont touch. its the same way around if you do bleave in @CAPS4 and you think that all book that tell about a witch or vampires or that my even have a hore house in just leave it alone. its just a dam book let us read them. See you guy blame us kids that the vido games roten our minds but realy its the parent that dose @CAPS1 see there is nothing more a teenanger like myself loves to do more than to do something there mom or dad says not. So gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do.",2,2,2,2,2
3949,2,"The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere.     The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to.     The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of.     If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want.     Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This @MONTH1 be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to?     Although to some people this argument @MONTH1 go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world @MONTH1 come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want.",5,4,4,5,5
3950,2,"Do I believe that certain materials , such as books, music, movies,magazines, and so on should be removed? Yes I think that they should all be removed, becuase it could hurt people's feelings, and could make them do plenty of things. Such as suicide, drama, and so on having any of these things at a library could hurt someone's feelings. I really dont think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book so why would anyone else? I think that by removing all these things could make some peoples lifes better.     From exsperince in the library last week, I seen this girl that ran to her mom crying becuase she was african american, and the book said something about thier race. And she was all worried that what happend back in the day with all the slavery would happen again. I would be so terified reading about people that would make fun of my life, call me names, and beat me, that kind of thing would just ruien my day. Now I think that library's would learn to take this certain stuff out of stock.     Now that I have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience. I think that they should take my advice, and realize that having that kind of stuff is not good for kids,teenagers, or even adults that they should not be reading that stuff. All it does is bring some people down, make them cry, and also so stupid stuff. Now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart, and make things better for everyone",3,2,2,3,3
3955,2,"Some people often go to the library to check out books,movies,magazines,etc..But what some people might not realize is that some of the things that they have at the library might be offensive towards certain people. I think that everything thats in the libraries should stay there. Obviously the library allowed it there for some reason. So honestly it cant be that bad.          I do not think certain things should be removed from the library. People have to realize that that's life. There's going to be certain things that you dont like but you have to deal with it. If you watch tv you'll notice that there's some offensive things towards certain people. But no one really makes a huge thing out of it.               The books might be offensive to you but to someone else it could just be another book that they want to read.With no intentive purpose of offending anyone. The library is all about learning. Everything is for educational purposes. I've read books that I stopped and thought about for a second while I was reading it and noticed that theres some pretty harsh things in it. But i didn't complain about it, I just kept reading.            Alot of books are based off of true events so no matter how offensive they are to people, you just have to think what the purpose was for the author to create this book and same thing with movies. So people can see what the author has to say. Everyone has the right to have their own opinion. And thats what most magazine articles are about. Expressing what you think about a certain topic.          Even in the @CAPS1 class that im in now we had to read 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3'. Some @CAPS4 @CAPS5 people might think its racist but it reallu isn't. The author is trying to get his point out. Of how things use to be before white and colored people were treated the same. Now if you still think that is being offensive towards you or other people then thats alright. That's why this is a free country. Everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it.          So I hope i got the point across that it's alright for some things to be offensive towards people. As long as thats not the whole point of what you watching or reading. Which i doubt it is. So next time your reading or watching something that is offending you. Think about the point that the person who wrote or made the movie were trying to get across. Mybe by it offending you it is getting the point across.",4,3,4,4,4
3956,2,"Censorship can be a very good thing. It keeps inapropriate material from falling into the wrong hands. It also keeps the horrors that are in the sensored material out of the community and that makes the community a better environment to live in. But too much censorship can become a bad thing. For instance @ORGANIZATION1 had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books. There also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book @CAPS1 @NUM1. Libraries should censor some of there material.      Books and magazines need to be censored according to there content. Books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get there point across. If a book is using vulgar and inapropiate language in should be in some way censored. With this in mind I should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog. I also shouldn't be able to find the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine. Also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore. Magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across. If there are inapropriate pictures in either of the two sources that material should be censored. If I am walking through my local library and just see a magazine sitting ou with a nude picture on the front I'm going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Another example would be that I pick up a book and start looking through it and it has an inapropiate picture in it, I am going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Also if a magazine has an extremly violent picture or extremely gorey picture it should be cnesored. Overall if a book or magazine is extremely inapropriate, then it should be, in some way, censored.     Music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored. Musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people. If that artwork includes swear words or inapropriate pictures it should be in some way or shape be censored. Musicians also play music of course. But if the lyrics to there songs are explicit or has many sexual themes it has to be conesored. Someone should have to deal with wading through music like that. No matter what, if an album of music is out of this world inaproiate, it should be censored.     Movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor. This is because they use language, pictures, music, and video. Movies are multi-media monsters that can sometimes be very clean, and sometimes be very inapropriate. If a movie is rated @CAPS2 it should not be in a public library. Movies that are rated @CAPS3 for seual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored. A kid should not be able to get his hands on that kind of stuff in a public library. Also depending on how violent and a gorey a movie is it should be cenesored. Movies that are inapropiate, especially ones rated @CAPS3, should be censored.     The fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad. But it does so we must censor certain things that people @MONTH1 get a offended by if they saw it in there public library. Things containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence to possibaly be censored. There also needs to be a line where we stop sensoring or pretty soon, just like Katherine Paterson said we won't have any books left. But overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries.",3,3,3,3,3
3957,2,"As an individual and what books I have read, I believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf. My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. This also includes music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. The less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway.         We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. theres even songs about it, no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items we @MONTH1 see positive results.     Like I said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials. They will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they're older. In the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf.",3,2,3,3,3
3959,2,"If there is any books, movies, music or magizines that is offensive, then I think it should be removed from the bookshelf because of caution for little kids. Everyone wants to look at different movies, books or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have too know where kids get acts from. The books can be left on the shelf, if the younger kids does not bother them. They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows. There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if its not right for there kids. Yes, books, magazines, movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive. This is neccasary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures. So have kids stay away from offensive materials.           There is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to. Such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v. shows or even movies. If the movie is offensive then it should definantly stay off the shelfs. Inless it is just grown ups in the house. If movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house. Younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room.           Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the @CAPS1. If parents don't want there kids growing up to be bad people then I advice all parents to keep the worse @CAPS2 away from children and hide them all. They can always hide them in the rooms, in a desk draw for child safety. Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around.      Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not neccasary for children. Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it. There @MONTH1 be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young. So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them.      I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good. Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from. If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it wont be bad. They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults. So, sometimes you have to treat them like an adult. Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive. Movies needs to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines needs to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they arn't suppose too.",4,4,3,3,4
3963,2,"Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves.  Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.      One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections.  Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice.  It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book.     Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned.  If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today.  If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone.  Censorship holds back many artists true potential.  Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world.     I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left.  Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else.     Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something.  As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right.   Censorship shouldnt be in libraries.",3,3,3,4,4
3965,2,"Dear @CAPS1,                    To @CAPS2 Or @CAPS3 To @CAPS2     @CAPS5 it wrong to ban a book?  It has come to my notice that this @CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that any person finds offensive.  To this I disagree.  The world @CAPS5 a better place to live, when everyone has a level playing field.  Some information @CAPS5 sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the @CAPS6 itself. Our country @CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech, to deny that @CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country.  To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time @CAPS5 right from a guardian's viewpoint.         Our country has many problems, but a few of them are @CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6.  In the @CAPS6 it @CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech.  This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter.  This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips.  There was just an example of this, inside the @LOCATION1,when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6.  However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some.     The world @CAPS5 a contantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant.  This @CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types.  No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future.  At this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation.  The only problem with this @CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten.  The internet @CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad.  To block all of this information just can't be done, but to restrict it @CAPS5 our only hope.     To to create such a restriction, our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances sytem that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works. Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections.  A perfect example of this would be off of '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13' when @CAPS10 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher.  That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age.     As humans we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading.  To block any part of this experience @CAPS5 to block our full potential.  Many things are offensive, but then again much of life @CAPS5 offensive.  Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6, and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information.  This @CAPS5 a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them.  We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children.  To do this we must create a program that allows those that want view what they want, and those that are too young view what they are allowed by their guardians.",4,3,3,4,3

There are books that children or young adult should read and should not read. This @MONTH1 vary for it depends on age, and the way the reader will understand the content of the books. There are cursing, smut and @CAPS4 in books that for children should not read.     In highschool there are some books like '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' that has cursing in it. For highschoolers of @NUM1 or older will be alright to read. Highschoolers understand and has heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a @NUM2 grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it. Childern in that age range will not understand that the man is handicaped, then the childern would not understand the killing the handicaped man had done or why his friend killed him after it.      Will a parent let a @NUM3 year old read a smut novel? This depend on the way the parent was raised and how the feel it will effect the childs development. An @PERSON1 book would not be approprent for a child of that age for the child does not, and will not understand the book it self. The book is more then just that one part of smut. There is a gothic and romanic was of writing to @PERSON1 books. A child of @NUM3 years old would not have developed the mature way of think of the book.      @CAPS4! '@CAPS4 is not the answer.' Everyone has heard this saying. This say is said but its not followed. Young adults play video games, read books in school related to @CAPS4. '@ORGANIZATION1's don't @CAPS5' is a book of a colored teenagers going to a white school. This is a book giving the kids to see how things were. A child in elematenry would think its funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will is it a game and do not have enough background or maturity to under stand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do that. For just watching a tv show with hit or punch the child will think it is ok to do it.     Over all there will be @CAPS4, cursing and smut novels out there. The thing it depends on the parents and maturity level of the person/child. There is a wrong and right way to do it but for @CAPS1 it not right to let some underage read a curse, voilents, or smut",2,2,2,2,2
3986,2,"What is the extent of reading that should be read by the public world? There are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby. Books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new world for readers. The latest gossip can be found in many magazines. Music is sometimes said to help people cope with life problems. Movies can open up peoples' imaginations and make them feel emotions for a theme of no importance. All these things make up peoples lives. Without any of these enjoyments what would people do with their free time? Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off shelves. They're huge factors that make up the society and make life what it is.          Books and magazines are two fun things people love to read. Fiction or nonfiction? No matter if books are real or fake they create stories that interest people. Reading is a hobby that's been around since the beginning of times. There are many different selections in reading, for example, adventure, mystery, comedy, or love stories. People will always read no matter what. Most books read are the ones that are sad and sometimes gruesome, but those are the stories that draw people in. Magazines are often picked up when going into the check out line in a grocery store. People love to read gossip, and learn about the latest trends. Magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people. When reading a juicy title, most people can't help themselves but to pick up the magazine and learn what's going on in someone else's life.          Music is used for so many different things. It's often listened to when driving down the road. Many people fall asleep to soothing instruments that make a beautiful melody. Lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge. There is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples' moods. On most @DATE1 nights, it is always seen that movie theatre's are very crowded. Movies bring out imagination and stories where people can watch and follow along. When watching a movie with a sad ending, most people cry. Although not always real, it touches people on an emotional level. Movies can bring things to life.          Life is what it is from contributing factors. All people think differently and like unsimilar things. Books, magazines, music, and movies all relate to peoples' likes and dislikes. Taking things off the shelves because they are offensivc or don't alway make people feel good, won't make our world any better of a place. If anything it will take away happiness in the world. These things make people feel different in ways that can't be described. Most often things that are offensive is the truth. Why hide things that are real? What would writers, musicians, and actors do if they couldn't do something just because it could offend a couple people out of millions? All these things are comfort for some people.          Books, magazines, music, and movies make the world and everyday life what it is. They are simple things in life, but once gone they are a huge gap missing. Things are fun and creative because of books, magazines, music, and movies. In my own experience books make me interested in subjects, magazines fufill my want for reading about celebrities, music makes me feel happy when I am sad, and movies make me feel like I can feel the same emotions as the characters do.They should not be taken off shelves just because they are offensive, they are part of life.",4,4,4,4,4
3990,2,"Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view?     For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages.     Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to.     Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you.     With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech.",5,4,4,4,4
3994,2,"There are many opinions on censorship in libraries. Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while other believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and its free will that allows people to pick up these books. No one if forcing them to read them.      I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion. I feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate. For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrong doings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate. Some poliliticians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter. Another example would be a book on religious purposes. For instance, a book on an @CAPS1 religion. Some @CAPS2 might take it as offensive if the informations paints them as being a certatin stereotype, but others @MONTH1 see it as educational learning.      I also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will. No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song. It's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us. I feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who @MONTH1 be coming to rent the book that day. Its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter.      I also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes. I believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive. I think that the library is a place where people can go and research information. Some of the material found @MONTH1 be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong'. I think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational books would not be available today.      The library is a place where our free will comes into play. I feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries. These books all contain information that could be veiwed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decifer for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable. I believe that no one should decide for us",4,3,4,4,3
3997,2,"If content in a library is considered offensive, @CAPS1 should still remain on the shelf regardless. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but select few will still value the media for what @CAPS1 is. Taking one kids cake because @CAPS1 has to much frosting would anger most kids (and adults).If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material @CAPS1 should remain organized with the rest of @CAPS1's kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media @CAPS1 they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content.I personally find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or in the context of a song, @ORGANIZATION1 fascinating. Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with @CAPS1's violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree @CAPS1 should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read(or listen) without their consent.I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to.",2,2,3,3,2
3999,2,"As far as opinions go, everyone has one. Only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an arguement for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in ones opinion shouuld not be omitted..     At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed.      Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would  be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of @NUM1, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding.     Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the childs curiousity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and @MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplist solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.     Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book becuase they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read.          To agree to removing information form the library is absoulutely purposeless, and @MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom @MONTH1 have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reaason is to entertain, inform, and educate. By  removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be.",4,3,4,4,3
4001,2,"In all libraries you are offered a choice on which book you would like to choose. So if you want to read a book with no censorship or if you want censorship then you can. The libraries should not take away books because of the content, in my honest opinion it should be the readers choice and not someone elses.      When choosing a book you have to think, do I really want to read this? each book gives you a little description on the back of the book giving you a little inside so you can tell if you would like to read the book or not. I do believe if it has sugested content that you should not let little kids read them but at a high school level we pretty much are able to make choices for ourselves.      Music should not be censored because if  a song says something that you dont want to hear like cussing or sugestive content then just turn the station. You dont have to sit and listen to the song, you can change it with a click or push of a button. Songs that are on the radio are for enjoyment and entertainment so you made the choice to go to that station and listen to the music that is on it, you made the choice and nobody can make it for you.      With movies they have a description on the back that tells what is going to be in the movie and what it's rated, if you don't want to watch a moive with bad language or bad content you should not have chose the movie in the first place it is clear as day on the case what will be in it. On movie cases it even gives you pictures of certain scenes and if they seem a little sugestive then put it back and select a differnt movie.      Magazines are meant to tell the truth and sometimes the truth is hard. Magazines are stocked on shelves in stores and on the front will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself. If you are really bothered by certain language thumb threw the magazine and see if it is approprate or not for you.      Libraries should not have to get rid of books just because some content, a person who walks threw those doors should be aware of what is in the library and what exactly they will find. In libraries they have catagorys in which certain topics are under, by going towards a selection it is saying that you understand what type of book it will be",4,4,4,4,4
4007,2,"Books now an days have action, romases, and, etc. So that's why the books that are not moving off the shelf is because they don't have what other books have. So they just sit there well most of the other books that are getting off the shelf are the happy @CAPS1, The @CAPS2 side, The @CAPS3,and all of the vampor books. It's because they have action, love, and etc.     The books that are on and off the shelf. Are maybe really good books. Some books don't ever leave the shelf it's probably because they are not. Really that great the reason for it is because the books that are on the shelf is. Because the book is  boring, or a old school book, they really don't have what the raeder is looking for. However the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the @CAPS2 side. That book has gotten sold faster than the movies.     The reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because. The books from the movies like the @CAPS2 side. Is bacuse the author gives more informotion on the movie. I heard that, that book is nothing like the movie the book is so much better than the movie because the book gives more informotion on the movie. So their for poeple really like books that from a movie.     They are more reasons why poeple like books now and days. You don't have to go to a book store anymore the books are now on your iphone, ipod, itouch,ipad and a nook,etc. So now you dont have to go to a book store anymore. You can get it on you iphone and other stuff poeple are raelly happy that they dont have too get up in the morning or when ever they get they books. They can however now just get them on the go.     So that is why books are now on the shelfs for good. Because you can get it on the go. But I believe that poeple whom ever like the feel of book. Should try and  just go out and get a iphone or nook something thaat saves you time while you are on your way to work or school",2,2,2,2,2
4013,2,"I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries. Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. If people would like to buy inapporpriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not.     Certain material such at rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers. Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that.     People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library.     Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library.     I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far to young to know about.     The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it.",4,3,3,4,4
4018,2,"Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries. Whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1, someone is going to be offended. But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike. I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press.         You could take any famous work and someone could be offended @CAPS5 it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned! Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we have total freedom of the press. You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in @PERSON1's @CAPS4 @NUM2, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age.      To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage. @PERSON2 @LOCATION1 that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' @CAPS5 saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended @CAPS5 every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances.      The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going @CAPS5 making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. @CAPS5 allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers. In this case, @CAPS5 keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history",5,4,4,4,4
4019,2,"The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves",4,4,3,3,2
4041,2,"Books @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3      @CAPS4 your in a library its many book that children decide to read that @MONTH1 not be suited for their @CAPS3. Many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now. But some book aren't for children @CAPS3.     Now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @CAPS4 kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention. Some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion. Most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing. @CAPS4 a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. Im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will.     Some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read. Kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it. I beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away. Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. Just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. The things kids see they soon try out. They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things. All books aren't bad for children @CAPS3 but some are.      I notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. People should'nt think that way  because its alot of crule people in this world. I even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. So many teens read that book and found it interesting. And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends. That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. Its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. Most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children. The things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @CAPS5 should read.     Books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inaproprate things in it should be removed from the shelves. But certain people interpret the words different and veiw it different. Its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf. But its going to keep going on until someone speaks up.",3,2,3,3,3
4047,2,"As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate. However this should be their decision and only their's; not other parents rallying together to get their desired results; the removal of certain books.      In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them. When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate. Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to.      So, if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it; and disobey parents. They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education. So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway. So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually they will see it. Do you want that?",2,2,3,3,3
4049,2,"I do not believe that such things as book, music, movies, magazines,etc., should be removed from libraries.      First, books can be used as monumental learning sources for kids, teenagers, and adults. Just because a book talks about the @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 dying @MONTH1 be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults. Also books give a message about how times use to be. Take a book that refers to slavery and what they use to call black @CAPS9 back then. Just because it has some words that are frowned upon does not mean that kids and @CAPS9 shouldn't know about it and where it came from so they won't go around affending @CAPS9 and they don't even know what the word means.      Next, movies now some movies shouldn't be played for certain age groups and I understand that, but movies like @CAPS2 and To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 are teaching us our @ORGANIZATION1 and how far we've come from being segregated and the disrespect of each others race. Also movies gives a more visual way of what things were like so we can kind of get a interactive way on how things look like and how you can relate the book to the movie. Movies also make points, some state if we don't do anything about pollution this is whats going to happen. So movies are definetly a stay on my list.     In addition, a big factor of @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 is music. I could see how some music could be bad but also some artist talk  about how it really is tough where they come from and how music is a get away for them. Plus, music isn't hurting anybody. We learn how music was in the @DATE1 and compare it to music now. We also learn how music evolves from one thing to another, kind of creating off of itself. Music has the power to say things and communicate with @CAPS9 and make statements that could only be made by music. For example, take somebody giving a speech about what they feel or what they think. Now take that speech put it in a song form and I guarantee that more @CAPS9 capture the message and take it into there grasp on how they could help the cause. Especially if it is by their favorite artist. Say your favorite artist is @CAPS7 @PERSON1, now wouldn't you rather listen to @CAPS7 @PERSON1 make a statement about life or a political view rather than a song like that by @ORGANIZATION2. So music is most definetly staying on the list because it has the power to move @CAPS9, make you feel different ways, and look at things you've never seen in away before.     Last, magazines, some Magazines are just inappropriate.  Now I'm pretty sure that you will not be seing those magazines on shelves of a library so nobody should be worried about that. Now some magazines like @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 are just there for fun and they are not hurting anybody because its just pictures and honestly no child would read the words of a interview with a famous person. So magazines are harmless to in a library and are only there to stay up on current events and to inform @CAPS9 on if a new discovery was made or whats going on in the @ORGANIZATION1.     In conclusion, I do not believe that things such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves anywhere.",5,5,5,5,5
4051,2,"Libraries.     What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers.",2,2,2,2,2
4053,2,"Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read. Most books and movies are filled with sex,gang violence, and drugs. In my generation sex, durgs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere. Books are suppose to be about learning. Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.         Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of  offensive behavor. You should be able to open a magazine and   learn somthing brand new.    Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics. Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with  the topic you dont want. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence.     If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved  with what you read. Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's. Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children.     Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit. there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library.",3,2,2,3,2
4058,2,"To who it @MONTH1 concern:     @CAPS1 you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of liturature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries.     In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe.      Liturature can be described as art that an individual portrays it as in his/her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day. This means it has been there wars, politics, art and slavery. All of these are a part of liturature, so liturature is history in it's own way.     Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries. they might think that it should be removed from everywhere. It should not. It is a part of history. @CAPS1 you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at that certain time. It tells us what was happening in that part of the world. It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right. Many people thought is was right. They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs in return that they respect our's.     Liturature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldnt be where we were today. Liturature should stay in the shelves of libraries where they belong. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. @CAPS1 you want to be know for destroying an important part of history",3,3,3,3,3
4060,2,"Should someones work catagorized as 'inappropiate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for @CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.     When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3.      Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.     When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.      If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again.     In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny. Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'",3,3,3,4,3
4072,2,"Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indescent to read or not.     We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What @MONTH1 look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong @MONTH1 be completely normal to the individual they are making the decison for.     Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisons is one of the human races greatest talents. These descisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1. When the government is making decisions that effect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom?       When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. Theses ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books to?      In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types or movies, books, ect. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment.      I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions. This right should never be taken away from us",5,5,5,5,5
4080,2,"Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @MONTH1 find to be offensive @MONTH1 not be ofensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of      @CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material @MONTH1 be to them",5,4,4,4,4
4081,2,"Do believe that any boook or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes it into offense? No, it should not be removed. That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book. They have a problem with the book, not everyone else if the book was good enough to be published that means someone wants to read the book which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion.       In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says,'All o fus can think of a book that we hope none of uor children or any children have taken off the shelf. But i fI have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries. If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material.     If someone finds something offensive they should simply stay away from it. Everyone has their own view of everythings they come across which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it. So simply because the boo or other form of material offend you that doesn't mean that its worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores.     Don't get me wrong I believe in some forms of censorship. I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries. I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book, novels, poems, etc.      I believe that if something is offensive to you that's your opinion and there's an easier way to not hav eyour children read the than getting the book removed, just don't bring the book to your children stay away from the book as much as possible. If you @MONTH1 come across it just don't acknowledge it. Your children are more at risk of being in a carcrash then reading a nonapropriate book only if you teach them correctly, not to sound harsh but to shine reality on the fact. That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores",4,3,4,3,3
4084,2,"Today in our day and age we have books, music, movies, and magazines that say or show materials that young children and teens should not be seeing at their ages. I am writting your newspaper company to tell you that I think the censorship should be implied more in libraries. Their should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. that the parent has to sign before that says, '@CAPS1 child can see or hear the materials being displayed.'      In this centry we have @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows showing violience, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs. Its almost impossible to keep all children away from these things, but we should at least try to. There are shows on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 now showing teenage pregnencys, and they are pursading the viewers that its okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person. @ORGANIZATION1 shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize with no conserquence. Also they have violence and uneeded langauge.      I know from @CAPS1 own experience watching @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 dad has came into @CAPS1 room, and told me to turn it off. That they shouldn't be allowed to do somethings they are showing the viewers. I know when I am married and have children I will keep @CAPS1 kids away from certain materials as long as I can until they are old enough to understand, and know the right thing to do in the situation. Some of the language they use such as 'retard' I find offensive.      In @CAPS1 opition the censorship in libraries and in households have really declined. Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors. A good parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching is appropraite for there age.      Even books have sexual contact, and language. When I have children I will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them. Magazines these days are even worse. The call the @CAPS7 '@CAPS6 @CAPS7' for a reason, and young teens are picking it up off the shelves at conveniate stores and are reading it. Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, refuring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs. Parents need to get more involved in their childrens life, and what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring.   I hope you read this essay and really take it into concerderation. I hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you for your time",3,4,3,3,3
4099,2,"Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.       Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.      Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example. The movie industry might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries.      Music artist might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.      Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work",4,4,3,4,4
4101,2,"Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them",5,4,4,4,4
4106,2,"Read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 ?     Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so. These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library.          People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching.           Genre comes in all kind of different types. For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only. Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand.     All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section.          All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media",3,2,3,3,3
4109,2,"There are many different perspetives on censorship in our country.  This is the human race, opinionative that is.  Different perspectives come from different people: young, old, parents, and children.  In libraries there are some reading materials, that some @MONTH1 find offensive.     Offensive material in libraries is @CAPS1 directed to be read by young children.  They are also @CAPS1 inteded to be able to get there hands on such material.  Even though this is @CAPS1 the purpose of that material, it happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it.  No the material is @CAPS1 held under lock and key, but it is also @CAPS1 left to lay at a child high shelf that would seem appealing to them.     The problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelfs, except for the children's books.  The material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories.  If we protected children from censhorship this would deny knowledge, and also a get away for some, from the general public that anually go to the library.\     @CAPS1 all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be.  Some material @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be appropriate for children, but they also are @CAPS1 all inappropriate.  A rated '@NUM1' movie @MONTH1 be just like a rated '@CAPS2' movie only with one extra reference, that @MONTH1 be taken in the wrong way.  Even protective parents @MONTH1 allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate.     Libraries should @CAPS1 remove this material from their shelves.  If it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children books in a seperate room of the library.  There are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children.  All of which do @CAPS1 have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves.     Censorship in libraries is a contraversial subject.  There is a very good arguement on either side of whether or @CAPS1 to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries.  I believe it should @CAPS1 be taken off and there are alternatives to this.  This essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone",3,3,3,3,3
4122,2,"Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?     I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on whats offensive and what isn't like some people will find something funny that some people @MONTH1 think is nasty or inapropiate. If you was to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has they're own oppenion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but thats the parents decision, not everyone has the same view on the material.     Certian materials should not be removed from shelves because of one persons oppenion on it. Everyone has they're own oppenion, some people like what other people don't everyone is different in they're own way",2,2,2,3,2
4123,2,"I firmly believe that the removing of books, music, movies, ect., from a shelf just because someone finds it offensive will not solve the problem. A person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views, but they can not just remove them. To remove books, music, movies, ect., from people who do not find them offensive could provoke chaos.          As Katherine Paterson stated 'And then we have no books left.' If everyone were to choose books, music, movies, ect., they felt were offensive and should not be placed in the library the statement would probably be true. Besides the point the library is sectioned off into different genres, so if you have a different view of a certain genre of books, movies, music, etc., skip over that section and go to the genre in which you prefer.     In other words, the things that @MONTH1 offend one person @MONTH1 not offend another person. So to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject. So instead of there being a problem with one person there would a problem with two unsatisfied people. Not saying that it is right, but the library has done particular things such as, separating the books for reasons like this.     According to Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The library has a section for children only. Therefore worries of problem like this have already been solved. The books, music, movies, ect., in the childrens section is age apprioate for a child. Books, music, movies, ect., are also sectioned off for teenagers and adults.     In conclusion, the removal of books, music, movies, ect., that are found offensive by others @MONTH1 not be found offensive by someone else. It is not like the library would purposely offend anyone by having the books, music, movies, ect., on the shelfs. If you are mature enough to understand that and over look something that @MONTH1 offend you, you would not be so offended. Also if the library is sectioned off into different genre, you can easly by pass a particular genre you wish to avoid. Problems can  be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner.",3,3,3,3,3
4124,2,"I dont think so becuase what if that is all the person likes to read.  They could put all the bookes in to diffrent sections so that littel kids wont be learning words they shouldnt know wright now.  the librarian could also make it where you have to be a sertaint age to cheak out a book.      There are a bunch of ways to orginze them in to sectoins like make a kids section, a teenager section, and even an adult section. But i dont think the should take the out of the libary for good, becuse there are a lot of good books with some bad words in them. just becuase ther are some bad words in abook does not mean the book is bad",1,1,1,1,1
4133,2,"With the world having a wide variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some and not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have purposes as to why they were created. This @MONTH1 be to entertain, inform, or persuade. People use libraries as a source to see these works. Many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun. My opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf. A library is a place where one should be able to find a book, cd, video, or magazine or any subject that interests them.     If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library. Any item you read or listen to will have a word, sentence, or meaning that will offend a person in some way. This is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased. The way an author tries to entertain @MONTH1 offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone. Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you @MONTH1 not agree with the side the author chooses. The same goes with informing. You @MONTH1 think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did. All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone. I once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers. The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad. This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it and saw a different point of view. Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf. You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear. However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research. This is why all items need to be available to the public. If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers. Likewise, if there is an item rated '@CAPS1' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners. With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy.     With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry. While you @MONTH1 like a book, I @MONTH1 find it offensive. Even though I @MONTH1 have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people. The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public. It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants. Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library. Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him. We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear. This is how a library serves a community",5,5,4,5,5
4140,2,"I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf. I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up.      I'm a @CAPS2. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things. And its something that would have to be done.      Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing.  I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others",1,1,1,2,2
4143,2,"As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines ect.. should be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read. I do believe that younger children like middle schoolers/preschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for highschoolers and older I think that it should be our choice. I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truely offensice they shouldn't allow them to be published. Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there. We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries. Like Katherine Paterson said ' And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books music ect.. because they believe they are offensive there would be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to.I believe that highschoolers and older should be able do decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to. If you dont like a certain type of music dont listen to it, if you dont like the way a book is written, dont read it. No one is making you to read or listen to something that you dont want to. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive to some @MONTH1 be eye oppening to another. In books we learn about war and things that I fing gruesome and unnessisary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life.I do believe that younger children should be censored form books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enought to know what is right or wrong, and they dont know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are found offensice to parents with younger children and in younger sections of libraries.",3,2,3,4,2
4146,2,"These days there are many kinds of merdia in the liberaries beside books. There are musics, movies, magazines and many more. There are all kind of things and resources that you can find from liberaries. Do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive? What do you think? I think it shouldn't remove. Even it is stuff that you don't want children to know, they will know someday. Once we remove it from the shelves then more things, the informations are going to removed. After all, nothings is going to be leaft.     There are a lot of imfornation in this world. Growing children learn all kind of stuff from parents, book and from other medias. Parent want to let their children to learn much as possible. However there are sutten things that parent doesn't want the children to learn. You need to think this way. That children will grow up and become adult, then they will know any way. Why would you move from the shelves, if they are going to know about it some how? What is a point about it? Doesn't removing from the shelves helps children to not know about it? I don't think there is a point to do that.     Katherine Paterson, the Author, said 'All of us can think of a books that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. I agree with Katherine. Once, the books or other mediea get removed because of some reason, other things are going to removed because of other reasons. I don't think it should be remove, like Katherine said there are nothing gonna leaft for the children. If nothing gonna leaft for the children what is main point of having libaries?     I believe the certain materials, such as books, music, magazines and many more, should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive, because children will know and need to know to be adualt. Also there is nothing gonna leaft for the children in the libareries",2,2,2,3,2
4171,2,"Today in our society many things can be taken in many different way. Many sayings, quotes and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not. The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true. Even with that being true, the question truly is, will it do you any good to take those things away? In my opinion offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children--espcially teens--will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time.      If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she @MONTH1 not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material. I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary. He or she @MONTH1 be able to take that privelege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world. A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing. I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive.      Being a teenager myself, I have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material. If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location. In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online. In this case it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive, could cause a big catastrophe.      When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be. For example a person could take up a funny book that is finding funny things in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing; something that reader could be involved in. Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it. Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material.     These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unesscesary. The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material. If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it; however, that librarian should not take the privelege to listen to or read the material from other people. Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people. With this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else",3,3,3,3,3
4174,2,"I feel that censorship in libraries is not needed. There are ways around your child having to be subjected to certain things you don't want them to be subjected to. If you don't want your child to witness certain types of material that is on you, not the libraries. We have libraries for the sole purpose of variety what is the point in having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone. There are ways around completely taking certain things off the shelf if they are that explicet then they can be put in a section just for adults. No I do not belive certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     One reason why it is not necessary to take certain things off the shelf is if you don't want your child to read or see certain things okay that's fine then watch them and see what they try to pick up and read or watch. Your child doesn't have to anything if you don't want them to. It's like saying I don't like this telivision show I never want my child to see it well what are the odds that telivision show is going to stop playing just becase your not happy with the violents,drug use,language, ect. The odds are extremely unlikely. When you don't want you child to see that certain show what do you do you watch them and keep them from watrching it so why should there be any differance when it comes to the books they are subjected to in a library.     Another reason would be the sole purpose of a libray is to give variety  to the people a place where there is something for everyone. Just because you think something is horrible and no one should read, hear, or see doesn't mean that some one else won't like it, it could be someone else's favorite book,magazine,cd, or movie. One oppinion shouldn't count for so much. If you don't like a book,movie,magazine, cd or agree with the content fine your entitled to your own oppinion then don't check it out no one is making you. If they took something off the self everytime they got a complaint about it there would be nothing left. If they were about to try and accomidate everyone they @MONTH1 as well just give up and close all libraries down all around the world because there will be nothing left on the selves.     Also instead of taking them completly off the shelf if they are that explicet maybe make an eightteen and older section. It would solve a lot of problems. Yes I agree that there are a select few books,magazines,movies,ect. that younger people should not be subjected to, but as and adult you should be able to read,watch,and hear whatever you want. That right shouldn't be taken away just because there are children that come to libraries. Every library I have ever been to there are certain sections and if your child stays in the section where there type of books are then they should be fine. Aside from that though an eightteen and older section would solve a lot of conflict.     No I do not belive certain material should be taken off the selves if they are found offensive. There are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves. I don't want to go to a library one day and there be literally nothing left because they took a book off the self every time someone had a problem with it. There is absolutly no reason why we can't figure spomething out to make everyone happy and I think that having the eightteen and older section would be a good start. For the whole i don't want my child to be sujected to those kinds of things then keep your child away for those kinds of things nobody is forcing them to read anything you don't want them to",3,3,3,3,3
4184,2,"The many books, movies, music, and magazines in the world could be offensive. In all of these examples there could be bad language, pictures, and messages. No matter where people go they can find something that could offend someone. No matter what, people will try and get rid of eveything bad but the truth is they are gonna be around forever if not a very long time.     In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 all the students in grade ten just got done reading '@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' The story is about a runaway @NUM1er named @CAPS6; and a runaway boy named @CAPS7. many librarys have banned this book because of the use of the n-word. '@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5' has profanity in it, and people don't want that book to be taught in @CAPS2. I personaly think it should be taught, because it shows students today what it was like back when there was slavery. Music is something that mostly everyone listens to. Songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about. many song artist write about love, money, and fame,  yet others write about drugs, profanity, and  suicide. Hip-hop, rap, country, rock, metal, jazz, r&b, punk, ect., are only a few of the hundreds of types of music out there; and at least @NUM2 songs of each type have a bad meaning behind it. Magazines and movies are the same way. Magazines and movies have everything between cars to bad pictures in them and historical places, facts, and documents to action. Even though there are age limits to buy or see stuff it still doesnt mean that it  couldent get into a teens hands.      Because there is bad language in music, movies, books, etc., doesnt mean it should be banned, just limmited. No, it is not wrong to put what you feel into a book or into a movie just make sure it is analized right so it can only be checked out or sold to the people of the right age. What the children and teens are into now will affect the world in a later time and keep on going untill there is a change made.",4,4,4,4,4
4191,2,I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right,2,1,2,2,2
4193,2,"Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people @MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody.     Think of some authors that wrote books like @PERSON1, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now.     Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature.     People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news.",3,3,3,3,3
4197,2,"Opinion      I don't think they should be removed because in books tell you what it is about in the back. Movies tell you what it is rated. It is mom's or dad's fault. They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spollied. they want every little thing in the world and the parants are buying it for them to make them happy.     The parants are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated @CAPS1 movies or get a rated @CAPS2 video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parants and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parants.     When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parants what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parants that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard.       I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it ment but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was preaty sure they didn't tell there parants because the one how told there parants got hit still woundering what it ment still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it ment i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again.     Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parants or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine beacuse it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this 'what you decide people will be against it no matter what'",2,2,2,2,2
4199,2,"Libraries are often thought of as a room full of books inside a school building. On the contrary, they are all over the country, and are used by people of all ages. Because of that, I feel that there should not be a restriction on what books a library puts on their shelves. If the books and magazines are labeled, then a person can just stay away from what he or she finds offensive. However, in the case of a school library, all the books of course should be age appropriate.     Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean you neighbor won't. If someone find a movie ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will too. Since all people are different, no one will like the same movies as the next person. Therefor, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual. That is the same with magazines, books, and anything available at a library.         Parental concern for their children is also a factor. However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that is found to be offensive by a parent of a young child, I do not think that should require the library to remove the book. This is where I believe organization and limitations come in. The adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room, or on a different level of the building. That would prevent the accidental discovery by children. Along with organization, I think there should be a limitation, so that if a child was to purposely walk into that section and grab a book that was not appropriate, or offensive to the parent, then they would not be able to check it out at the desk from the librarian.     Outside of public libaries, the school libraries have a different requirement in my opinion. Elementary libraries of course, should contain no inappropriate material to any extent.All of the material in an elementary library should be strictly for education. At that age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article. At the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 level, I think things should change a little, but should still be much more strict than a public library, and contain absolutely no offensive content. I feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers. Nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though of course.      Public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion. Because of that, there should be no restrictions in the public libraries, and you should be able to get the books or movies you want. Within a school corporation the environment changes, and the rules must be changed as well. Nothing offensive should be placed within a school library no matter how old the students are. Libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves.",4,4,4,4,4
4213,2,"Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world. Liraries are placs that house these very things for the enjoyment of all who visit them. This is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials. Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of living and libraies offer this to people freely! How can one take that freedom away from another?    Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occured in the ideal way. However, subjects such as slavery, the @CAPS1, and other controversial topics must be known about. These horrible happenings @MONTH1 offend some but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it. It is not right to hide the truth.    Some people are easily offended and some are not. But the true question is,'who is to say what is offensive?'. There are people who believe that discussing @CAPS2 in the christian religion is offnsive and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also. Yet there are still others whose believes directly contradict these. Libraries must maintain all types of material becuase their purpose is to hold knowledge and not just what people want to know.    How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occured in the past? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones! History has never been in the control of man.    In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people, and where we came from. Our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured.",5,4,5,4,4
4217,2,"Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society.  Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own.  Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media.  But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned.  Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech.  Censorship actively and violently violates that right.  Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away.  Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out.  Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves.  Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech?  We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say.  We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them.  Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives.  We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions.  And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance.  But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone.  But there will always be someone who is unhappy.  It's the inevitable truth.     Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world.  In a way this makes sense.  We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life.  We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors.  However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come.  Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  For example, let's look at the issue of rape.  Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens.  It is a nasty part of reality.  Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media.  We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist.  But that doesn't accomplish anything.  That doesn't get rid of rape.  It still exists.  And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop?  How will a rape ever be able to be prevented?  How will someone know what to expect or what to do?  By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape.  Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped.  Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it.  Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't.  It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.     We as people need knowledge.  We live off of knowledge.  And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media.  Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually.  It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp.  Is this fair?  Is this right?  Is this helping us?  How does cutting out knowledge ever help?  It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear.  It is human nature to fear the unknown.  The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear.  Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society.  This is wrong and immoral.  It is unfair, if nothing else.  We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists.  No good comes from hiding it.     Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways.  And as time goes on it can only get worse.  Censorship is based off of offensiveness.  If something could be offensive, it is disposed of.  However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone.  Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship.  This means all media of any kind should be destroyed.  No one should say anything.  The world would be forced to be silent.  All knowledge would be taken away.  Chaos would ensue.  The people's freedom would be completely taken away.  The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes.  This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue.  We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings.  These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.     Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us.  It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored.  Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away.  All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions.  A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues.  Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away.",6,5,5,5,6
4222,2,"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself?      Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note.      I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.         What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught.     Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall.  Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music",4,4,4,4,4
4228,2,"As a student at a public school, the libraries that I and many other students have access to are censored to an extent. With our library being censored I do not feel that the public library should be.          Why is censorship a conflict in need of discussion; every book found on a shelf is a part of history so every author that was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf. While school libraries are already censored for their age group; I feel that public libraries should not be censored for the plain reason that you, your gaurdian, but also the library has control over what they find age appropriate.           If disliking the book is a problem; then put it back. Find something more common towards your own interest. Some things @MONTH1 be considered inappropriate as many things are, but at the same time each person has their own limits to this. While someone @MONTH1 dislike a teen magazine because of how it effects youth, another @MONTH1 find it inspiring. If every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves; as Katherine Paterson expressed in her quote.          When you enter a public library; it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, ect.. When you enter a school library it is done according to fiction, non-fiction and author. Censorship amoung public libraries is not needed. Adults, students, and childeren all go to a public library. So, as the case @MONTH1 be why would you censor a library that goes for all ages. I feel that yes an @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 school library should not contain the same content as a @CAPS3 school library. But a public library, is for the public. Hints the name.          In conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. Some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, but also adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling. So as the fact @MONTH1 be that some things @MONTH1 seem innappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group.",4,4,4,5,4

I personaly the book should be kept on the self because its a life changing expersance for a young man. For some people this book they will or have even read this book several times, I know I have. I only hope that othere people will like or even love this book as much as I have.

Honestly i do not think that books should be taking off the shelves or music should be banned ect... I think that there should be a little more athority on the age limit of books in libraries, and a seperate place for music and other things of that nature. I would not want my kid to walk out of the library with a book about sex, gangs, or stuff that should not be known by a kid. Instead of banning or removing these kinds of books off shelves why not put a strict age limit on books, and actually stand by it. Yes there is an adult section a kids section ect.., but i've seen so many young kids walking out with books magazines and other adult items.       I know how it feels to try and concentrate on a book newspaper or magazine you are interested in when people are blareing there head phones. And i still feel the same way about the music as i do with books. Dont bann it from the library just bann it from certain areas of the library. Its all out of respect to people who are wanting to be in a quiet area.     Im not the type of person who wants to take things away from people because everyone has there own interests and beliefs in life, but i am one who believes in setting rules that should be followed.

People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries?     Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people @MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself.           People of different races and cultures @MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout. Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue @MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.      Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries. What will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.      Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us",5,4,4,5,3
4242,2,"We as @CAPS1 have the right to say what we want, and do as long as it is within the laws. If they take away some books because they are racey or because some people find them wrong, then they are saying we shouldn't learn the history of our civilization. A great man once said '@CAPS2 who do not learn from the past are condemed to repeat it.' @CAPS3 is saying that if we take away the books that are even obscured we are taking that history away from our children and they will do the same mistakes that we have done in our lifes.     Taking away the content that is obsene will make our children unknowledgable to the fact that it happened or how the past really was. '@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' is under critism because it uses the '@CAPS7-word' alot in the text. There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked, back in the day, and how things were done. If they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh, harsh thing.     When I think of censorship in the library, I think of how the @ORGANIZATION1 is trying to change the past and how it is trying to nurf the childrens history of what really happened. Censorshiop should be on tv, movies, and music so the little kids dont see the wrong things to earl, but when it comes to lititure in the library they shouldn't do it at all because only the liturate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying. There should not be a censhorship in the lititure of the past, the present, and the future.",3,3,3,4,3
4246,2,"Every parent wants to protect their child's innocence. They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions. The truth is though that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the @CAPS1. It is their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material.     One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It is all about choices. There are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people @MONTH1 want to read or watch something with such content. Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them. People should have the option to read or watch what they wish. Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to such topics.     Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 is a very true statement. After one censoring, people might still think topics are inappropiate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left. People eventually will not be able to use libraries. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource.      A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person might not be to another. How would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided? It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not. Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it. It is as simple as that.      There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are obvious. Censoring libraries are going to eliminate a person's choice. It will cause problems, as to what is appropiate and what is not. Eventually libraries will have nothing left. Of course every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices. Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things. All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong.",4,4,4,4,4
4250,2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern:     The idea of censoring books, music, movies, or anything else from libraries or from the public eye is very offensive. There are many things that could come off as 'offensive' to any individual. Taking books or anything off the shelf because someone felt that it did not go with their certain morals or beliefs is against the writer's freedom of speech. It also can start serious issues with feuding religious groups or persons of different ideas. This also shows that the library, or so far as the country, is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed.      One of the biggest concerns is that the freedom of speech is taken away. It @MONTH1 be something as trivial as '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' now, but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it, then our freedom is taken away. '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' was brought up because a mother had actually gotten a certain book of the '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' @CAPS4 taken off the shelf, because her child had gotten scared of the halloween edition. The fact that something could be banned for something so trivial is a frightening thought. There weren't many cases of this specific @PERSON1 scene scaring all the kids, so there was no need to get it banned. When someone finds something even a tad wrong they want it banned and thrown away, never again allowed to be shown to those that @MONTH1 even find an interest in it.     A big thing that @MONTH1 conflict with censorship is the idea of religion. The @CAPS5 is a published work, whether it is religious or not. Who's to say that it can't be banned? What if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive? This could cause even more conflicts between religious parties, and in turn anything religious would be banned all together. That small, faint line between state and religion is going to get blurred solely from censorship. If the @CAPS5 or works for catholics get banned, then so could published works for wiccans, muslims, buddhists, and any other sources of religion. There would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in. Not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works. It will then become a topic far less talked about, for they would be afraid of getting into legal or social trouble for expressing their thoughts and feelings with their spirituality or religion.     This censorship will only cause future issues. This could lead to not only the religious books being banned, but anything that strays from the social norms. If someone was homophobic, they @MONTH1 start having a gay author's works banned, or just a book about the @CAPS7 community banned. That small sense of security those in that community have in those books will be taken away. Personally, I find comfort and my sense of being alone is dulled by these books. There @MONTH1 even be a possibility that some books, not necessarily just @CAPS7 books, hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to. It is a world someone loves to enter, to hide or confide in. To take someone's mental safety is worse than taking their physical safety.     Most people do not realize what sort of trouble they will start with censorship. It @MONTH1 mean nothing, but those that decide whether or not to censor something have to think of the picture at large; Do they lose customers for keeping it on the shelf? Or do they lose customers, and stop giving the rights of freedom of speech? It is a heavy decision to make but the decision could make or break the publishing group or legal party",5,5,4,4,4
4251,2,"Devin @NUM1 @NUM2                                   @CAPS1 @CAPS2    Do you like the libary? There is always an argument about how books, music, movies, magazines, ete., should be removed from the shelves if people find them offensive. Which brings me to @CAPS1 @CAPS2; there is always the choice of a different libary to choose from. You also don't have to look at the book or watch the movie. Being an @CAPS3 author you have the freedom of speech, you can write whatever you feel like writing.      First, is your choice of libary. There is sevral different libraries in one town. Some have childern sections, where all the books are appropriate for young childern to read. Also the parents of the childern need to keep an eye on what their child will be reading, or looking at. There has to be at least twenty to thirty libaries in @LOCATION1, so you always have a different option.     Second, you don't have to read the book, or watch the movie. If you see something you don't like about the book, why complain about it? Just put the book down, someone else might be interested in the book. You have the freedom to pick out the book.       Last, is the freedom of speech of the author of the book. Being an @CAPS3 citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down. So people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down. Many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial.  Where would we be without those books and authors?     I have given you three reasons on @CAPS1 view of censorship in libraries. You have the choice of libraries, you don't have to read the book, and the author has the freedom to write what they choose",4,4,3,3,3
4255,2,"Have you ever been reading something that made you mad? Well, to be honest I can't remember the last time I walk into a librarie and found something there that could had offended somebody. But thats just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person.      No, I don't that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out.     Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve, but I could image that there are people out that are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others its hilarious.     All I'm trying to say just do'n get all upset over something that you have read.",2,2,2,3,2

Children  are the future , everything that happens in the future will be because of them . Now , with that done and said ; I would like to explain , and point out why we as people of @ORGANIZATION1 should overcome together and take books , music , movies off the shelfs . Drugs , crime , violance, movies , and etc .  Rappers most of the time rap about female ,killing people , and etc. Its doesn't mean that they do it , but it reflects on majority of our children . Music is heard everyday @NUM1 hours throughout televison , radio , and i pods . Its take it to even an  different level with to male gender . Calling female out of there name treating them how they were tought through music.     If they not listening to it , they  for sure watching it .Alot of the  problems come from letting children watching the wrong rating movies . Rated @CAPS1 is want they our now letting children watch ,and buy . So now its giving then a greater chance of failling life . So now we at two stikes with this stuff that we allowing our children to pick up off a shelf .   #@NUM2 thing we let them pick up and grab  is video games . @PERCENT1 of our children play video games . While the same time as we cant stop them making them , I strongly belive we can prevent from letting children buy them at the age level .Most of the games based on sex , drugs , violances , and languages. At this point children our taking it very  serious , and strongly believing they can do the same . Which leading to death or jail . Drug use , school dropouts , and crime rates our highly because of these same video games children our getting off the shelf. Strongly influncing  them to  grown up fast , skip over the childhood life . So why can't we do it ? I don't understand why we can't do it , when we have the power to . It will help us out so much for everybody future . Crime rate will go down , test scores will aprove , and our future will be brighter . For our sake , and our children .",2,2,2,3,2
4262,2,"Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music , movies , and other things for entertainment. Mainly children use the library more than any other age. The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed. No one wants to check out thinks that are offensive in any type of way. Not even books that will influence bad things. Therefore certain things shouldn't be allowed to be checked out in libraries.     Certain movies shouldn't be in the library. For example if a  child go to library they @MONTH1 see a movie that contains sexual activity and decided to check the movie out. The kid @MONTH1 be  underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate. The child @MONTH1 get in trouble by there guardian. In reality it would be the librarian's fault for letting the child check the movie out. That is why the movies should be censored.     On the cover of many magazines women as well as men bodies are exposed.That @MONTH1 cause children to be attracted to the magazine. They @MONTH1 even decided to check the magazine out. Children are influenced by the things they see. Seeing naked bodies would be considered setting a bad example.      In today's world all children listen to music. The music you listen to has a huge impact on your life. The music in libraries should be censored. Libraries should have music that encourage you to go out and be something in life. In my opinion only influential music should be able to be rented out.     Reading is the key to success. Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you. Not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex. Libraries should only have history, math , and educational books.     In conclusion everything in the library should be censored. A lot of children use the library. Therefore it should be age appropriate. No child needs to be put under a bad influence. Certain thinks should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion.",5,5,4,4,4
4263,2,"I think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some stuff in it that little kids could look at or watch. The movies and magazines will sometimes give some kids some ideas and the books should be removed because it had some words that people will be saying and the music should be removed because they have rap music. People shouldn't be listening to it. The music is sometimes not appropiate for all age and it can give people some ideas of what they say or do. The books and magazines can give people some ideas of what they say or do and they can believe anything of what they say. People should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music. They are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives. Peolpe shouldn't be listening to some rap music or read the magazines or read some books that will give other people some ideas. The books sometimes talking about what happened a long time ago and stuff like that and it sometimes offense people like that. The magazines sometimes tell people what happened in the past and thenpeople don't want to read any magzines anymore. The people don't want to listen to any music anymore or read any books anymore. Most people will think that most books, magazines, and music are bad for the kids and for the adults. I think that it is offensive because music is not a good thing to listen to like rap or hip-hop. The people shouldn't be listening to rock music and they should just listen to some music that are appropiate. The books should be appropiate for all age and they should read something that they like. They should read some magazines that they like and that are good and appropiate.  The music is offensive because they talk about inapproiate  stuff and they shouldn't be listening to it and the magazines have some inappropiate stuff and the books have some inappropiate stuff. The people won't like it and they might not want to check it out again or they won't check nothing out. I think that they should put some books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will like. They should put some magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read",2,2,2,3,3
4274,2,"Censorship has been around for awhile and a lot of people agree that there should be censorship on a lot of things like telivision, books, magazines, almost about everything. Some people are going a little bit too far when it comes to older teens. There not little kids and they shouldn't have things censored. Like when you go to see a rated @CAPS1 movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie.      For little kids I think that they should have things censored because there young. They just dont need to be hearing bad language and anything. Parents should also care about what there child hears or reads if there young. Some parents don't even care what they see or hear and they end up getting in trouble with there teachers if they say it. It seems like the younger kids are always learning bad language or bad habits and I think its sad because they shouldn't be around that. They pick up alot of stuff when there young so your like a role model for them.      I believe that older teens like @NUM1 and @NUM2 are more mature about this, if they read a book in the library that might have a bad word. Im sure they hear it all the time on the bus or when your in town. They going to hear it anyways so why try to stop it when there going to end up hearing it. Books are suppose to help you and give you the real thing. You can't just throw out books or censor them. Everybody has there different opinion and this is my opinion. When you get at a certain age you start to mature and realize those are bad things to say or do so I believe high school books or magazines or anything else shouldn't be censored",2,2,3,3,2
4276,2,"What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is.                                                Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand. Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. They use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless. People love movies. It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive. But, it's not up to anybody else. Magazines help people keep up with news. Most of the news can be very offensive. It is the people around you causing the offensive news. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news.                                          Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way. Everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel?",5,4,3,4,3
4280,2,"Books? Movies? Music? Magazines? We all like to read them, watch them, and listen to them. @CAPS2's hard to stop all that. Plus, @CAPS2's impossible to stop. Everywhere you go you can find these items. Such as the movie store, the mall, a gas station, a yard sale, and even your public library. People of all ages can go anywhere and get a book, movie, a @CAPS1, or a magazine and @CAPS2's perfectly fine. But, there is one problem. Censorship.     Yes that's what i said, 'censorship.' @CAPS2 means alot to some parents when @CAPS2 comes to their children. Espescially when @CAPS2 comes to the public library where they live. If a parent wants to take their kids to the library and get some books or movies or ect. that's okay but if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine has 'bad things' in @CAPS2 that children shouldn't see is a problem. They want to be able to enjoy the movie or @CAPS1 or magazine with their children but bad things like nudity, violence, racial pictures, or profanity can be really offensive to parents AND people alone, just not parents. A lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea. There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to look at or watch or read any 'bad things' because we all know that is not right. Kids are young and don't need to be learning about that stuff at a young age.      I think censoring is a really great idea and I think Libraries and other places that have books, movies, music, magazines, ect. should censorize there things. But if they wont censorize anything they should at least put them in catagories such as 'adults' or 'young adults' or 'kids'. If they catagorize the ratings then the parents and you know where to look for and don't have to worry about censorship. Censorship should be practiced everywhere.",3,2,4,3,4
4288,2,"Hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library. There are many, many things that shouldn't be exposed to children such as, sexcism,racism,rarted @CAPS3, pornography. So i am here today to tell you all about them things.      First off books that have racist comments in them should not be exposed to our young children.Why? Because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things thats the book does. Another thing is sex in books. I know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things. So to sum this up they shouldn't be allowed in public libraries.     The second thing that shouldn't be allowed in public libraries is @CAPS2-@CAPS3 movies. Things such as horror movies, porn, and many more. So young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age. It teaches them things that they shouldn't know about until they get a little bit older.      The last reason why I feel that many things shouldn't be in the libraries are for the @CAPS4 magazines. Those magazines just show everything they have all type of naked photos in them. These really do not need to be exposed to our young children because. Our little girls will think it is ok for them to take naked photos of themselves and post it in books and on the internet.      So all in all, all of these things should be banded from the libraries for many different reasons. So the @LOCATION1 should think about what I am saying. Just think if it were your children being exposed to innappropiate things",4,4,4,4,3
4290,2,"Almost every city in the @LOCATION1 has a public library. A place where the citizens can check out books, music, movies, magazines and more. Inside a library, there are different sections. There are kids sections, adult, fiction, and many more. Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not subject for children. A common question has been coming up everday life, 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?'                                               Libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children. As a child, you want to explore and know everything. Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice. Just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go. A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children. A library is made for everyone's access and not everyone is alike. Therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries. It should never be a libraries fault for containing things not appropriete for children in my belief. Almost every library is very organized into categories. If children are separated and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very out of reach for children. Society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children.                                           'All of us can think of a book that we hope non of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' said Author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came acrossed. However, as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me. A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did.                                                         There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see then taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library. If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening/watching. The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come acrossed. Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life.               I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because one-hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get ahold of, then I see no problem in the situation. The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in fron of. However, that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of. If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries.",5,5,4,4,3
4308,2,"Have you ever sondered through the libray just to specifically find that one good book, magazine, or even cd that didn't involve inapropiate material for once? You feel like a little kid in the shopping mall just inpatiently waiting to find that one toy, but it never shows up. You spend seconds, minutes, even hours still slowly pacing back and forth shelf to shelf, and finally you find it and you open it and see the most innapropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgure language, or even take a skim through the most offensive reading yet. Do you wish it'd change?     I visit the library every time after i finish my book, I have loved reading from the time I was little. Lately i feel like my reading iterest has gone down though, not due to my act of being involved in other things, but possibly because lately I feel like every book I pick up comes off offensive. For example I went to  the check out a new book, I was mind boggled at this time because unlike usual I had no clue on which book I was even interested on to read next. The librarian directed me to there new best seller and said addressed it and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. I checked it out and after the first paragraph I wanted to throw up. This book and too gory and i felt like it downgraded women, I was anything but satisfied. This wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. I just hope i could check out a book not so offensive and actually worth my time, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me.     Our library seems to be over packed with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because I love them. I label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time. I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end. Lately my opinion has changed though, these magazines are starting to alter and I don't like it. It seems as if I can't open my page without seeing a half dressed girl, some innapropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal display of affection. Seeing these vulgare images are enough to make me not only flip the page, but also never second guess about opening a magazine again.      Music is like a drug to me, and I am addicted. There is never a day that goes by that I do not listen to music, but lately music just isn't the same. I go to the library to check out some new cd's and it seems everything I bother listening to uses every curse word out there. I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actaully sell this garbage. I am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new innapropriate vocabulary.      I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there. We just need to find it again. I hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnesesary items at the library. I know i'd greatly appreciate it, and from what I heard many others would too. We want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind to take a glance at, and we won't music that won't pollute our brains",5,5,4,5,3
4321,2,"It is known that anybody is able to rent books, movies, music, and magazines in libraries. It is also known that some of the material in libraries @MONTH1 be offensive or inapropriet. While some people beleive that such items should be removed from the shelves, I beleive that books, magazines, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves. People should be able to read, listen, or watch watever they want to, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in their house then he or she doesn't have to get it, and it doesn't mean that something that seems offensive still isn't enjoyable.     The most important reason why I beleive that items that appear to be offensive should not be removed from library shelves is because people should be able to read, listen, or watch watever they want to. Anybody is entitled to his or her own preference. Some people prefer @CAPS1 rated movies or music with explicit content. If that's what people are interensted in then so be it. Anybody should not have to stop renting something that they want just because someone else doesn't want them to.     Furthermore, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in his or her house then just don't get it. Noone is forcing anyone to listen to or watch something that they don't want. It is actually a very simple matter. It's a choice whether someone wants to watch or listen to what they want, and they don't really have the right to be able to tell someone else that they can't watch or listen to what they want. If someone doesn't perfer something then they don't have to get it.     Finally, just because something seems offesnsive doesn't mean that it still isn't enjoyable. The @CAPS5 example that I can think of is a movie that is @CAPS1 rated. Just because a movie is rated @CAPS1 doesn't mean that it still doesn't have a good story or moral to it. Their are plenty of rated @CAPS1 movies that have won @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and plenty of other rewards. Another example is the singer @ORGANIZATION1. While his music @MONTH1 be offensive, their are still many people that enjoy it. Certain things that offend people can be enjoyed by other people.     In conclusion, noone has the right to be able to stop anyone from renting what they want from a library. People just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are only offensive if certain people beleive that they are. People can only choose what they want, and nothing more",3,3,3,3,3
4327,2,"I think that @CAPS4 is fine if you take them out. Your should be @NUM1 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated @CAPS1.     I have read some books that are really good,but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book @CAPS3 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' and @CAPS4 is really sad.@CAPS4's about this @CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but @CAPS4 was sad,but I read @CAPS4 because people were talking about @CAPS4.     Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch @CAPS4 but I do. I'm @NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes @CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell.     Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, @CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie. I watched them before though",2,1,2,3,2
4335,2,"Did you know that libraries contain books, movies, music, magazines, etc.? Yes ! They have it all, if you ever need something for research or a project just go there. But if there is something that you do not like, just keep going.           I do not think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I think that if it is something that offends you then you should just keep going. That 'something' that might offend you, could be helpful to others.          So, now you know if you ever see something that you don't like in the library just walk away. It could be helpful to you and others. If things offend you, how would the next person learn? They won't. Don't only think about your self, think about others in the situation also.",2,1,2,3,3
4343,2,No they should not have the cd's books and  etc off the store shleves. they should leave them on the shelve si think.  they should olny remove the old video games. and books and music. every other,1,1,1,1,1
4351,2,"One could understand why some would wish to censor libraries and remove all rude, unwanted, or offensive forms of media from thier shelves.  However, one must take into account that, as Katherine Paterson said, if one person has 'the right to remove that [a] book from the shelf...then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'       With that thought in mind, do we honestly think that censorship of libraries is a smart idea?  If everyone was able to pick and choose which books to be taken off the shelf or which music to ban, then we would have nothing left.  You simply cannot please everyone. Are there benefits? Of course there are benefits.  One certainly wouldn't want one's child exposed to certain material at a young age.  But one must not censor libraries!  If one wishes, as a responsible parent, that their child keep away from a particular book or movie, they should take that matter into their own hands and not condemn the book off the shelf.       By condemning the book, one condemns the author.  As an @CAPS1, one has the freedom of speech, and this applies to media as well.  The author has the right to author a book that some @MONTH1 view as offensive, and no one has the right to remove his or her right from the standing.     Paper burns at @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2.  In the classic novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, the protagonist struggles through life in a world antagonized by the banning and burning of books.  The story takes place in the future, however, it contains an interesting undertone that hints at the possiblity that this 'future' @MONTH1 be nearer than first imagined.  To be blunt, the protagonist's life is horrible, he lives in a world that bans books, yet he is quite the bibliophile.  He is employed as a fireman, not to clear fires, but to create them.  @PERSON2's firemen are responsible for the delicate task of book burning, which is a rather frequent occurance.  However, with the main character's love for literature, how can he burn books?     Throughout the novel, the character tries to come to terms with himself and attempts to put an end to the madness, only to be forced out of civilized society.  The book is freightening, but an amazing read: it emphasizes the dire reality of censorship.  It's everywhere.     Now, one certainly doesn't need to worry about @PERSON2's futuristic hell, coming to life any time soon.  But one should know the dangers of censorship.  No one person has the right to remove a book from the shelves that they feel is offensive, let alone ban it entirely.  The banning of books, is a banning of freedom.  Freedom of speech, freedom of ideas, freedom of thought.  Another disutopian world that comes to mind is the world of @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE1.  Though, granted, our society is certainly not headed for that any time soon, if ever: it is still a valid point.  Once some freedoms are removed, others will follow.     Libraries should remain entirely intact, forever.  Every person, every man, woman and child should have ample access to knowlede.  Whether this knowledge be gained through books, magazines, movies or music, it needs to be readily avaliable.  Instead of banning certain media, one should label said media with a warning.  Parents should have enough sense to pay attention and thus, the problem is solved.                 Censorship is wrong, censorship is unnessesary, and there are a plethora of alternative means for protection against pottentially 'offensive' media.  Thus, the case can rest with the knowledge that all forms of media need to availiable, no matter what the content",5,5,5,5,4
4352,2,"There are many books out there that parents would not want there children reading. Some books have violence and crimes, others have love and romance. But it is not the best idea to use censorship in libraries. There are many books out there that might not be good for children to read, but it might help them make better choices in real life. Also, we can not forget about freedom of the press.     With freedom of the press anyone can write about anything they want. They can write about the good, the bad, violence, crimes, love, and romance. Everyone has there own way of writing and there own imagination. Without imagination what fiction would there be for children to read. There would be nothing to write about without imagination. With censorship, there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read.     If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor. Wethear it is swearing, guns, killing, romance, or love. There is something in every book that in innapproperate for children to read. If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would nothing left to read, and the intelligence of children would drop dramatically.     Children read for many reasons, like to expand there minds and to enter a world where the book takes place. But what children might not know is that reading also strengthens there vocabulary. When children read they learn many new words that are in that book. While they are reading the book opens there mind to much more then what they are used to and normally around everyday. When they are reading the children expand the minds and also helps them with everyday situations. This is why I do not believe that censorship in libraries is not a great idea.     If libraries censorship books and everything else on the shelves there would be nothing left for children at the libraries. They would be stuck reading books where they do not learn anything. They would read the same books over and over, they wouldnt learn anything new. There wouldnt be anything the could expand there minds with. That is something we certinly do not want for our community or anywhere for that matter",3,3,3,3,3
4353,2,the scary book that you dont want your children to pick up off the shelf i think if your kids read it they would be scared having night mares and you probaly dont want that and if u have the right to move it your kids will have the right to move it because they see what you do they gonna wunt to do so u can do it when they are not around  and yea i believe that cetrtain materials.,1,1,1,1,1
4354,2,"Have you ever picked up a piece of material while in a library and it offended you? Would you want your children reading, watching, or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them? I don't think no parent wants that. Think about it, how do children have access to things like that? Is it all around or do children go and find it? Not every single child in @LOCATION1 is going to be protected from bad materials.     Most of the time after school, children stay in the house and do stuff instead of going outside. Inside of their house they have access to televison, computers, and music. They think why go outside when I have all this stuff inside? Truth be told children hear so much harmful things from everywhere and anywhere. Nothing is censored like it was back in the day. Now a days nobody cares if materials are offensive, just as long as they sell. That's not the way it suppose to be at all, everybody should want best for the children and young teens. People wonder why their is violence, bad attitudes, crimes, etc., because all the stuff we have access to.          Schools could help prevent this probelm by removing offensive materials off the shelves in the libraries. It's sad that type of material is available in a school, but thats how the generation is today. In a library only certain things should be done. Reading, using computers, working at a table. Children shouldn't be able to get on a computer and play games, or listen to music with bad words in it, or prehaps pick up a dirty magazine. Library should be a place for learning, doing work, and reading. If their is less offensive materials in a school enviorment that's one step into fixing this problem. Censorship is much needed everywhere, it would help out a lot",3,2,3,3,3
4357,2,"I don't think that certain materials in books, music, movies, and  magazines should be removed from shelves because I think that everyone has the right to say what they want to say, but I do think some things in books, movies, and music that might be appropriate for a high school student aren't appropriate for an elementary school student. Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students but not so much to high school students, it would just depend on what they are reading, watching, and hearing.      I've never experienced anything offensive in what i've read in any book before but I have experienced some in music i've heard. I didn't say really anything about it I just thought someone shouldn't have written this certain song that I was listening to and I didn't think it would really be that bad. It's mostly in rap music that i've heard that's really offensive and I think shouldn't have been even written. But I still think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say",2,2,3,3,3
4364,2,Ok some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad like this one sports magazine i read talked about some atheletes and their accidents. like one article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basket ball and he had the stomach flu and he was having a hard time playing cause he had to use the bathroom alot.'I mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves'. thats bad! And another thing why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them. Theres quiet a few books that are like that for an example theirs this book called 'wake' and its about a girl who gets pulled into other peoples dreams like there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual i thought wow why is this book in here. It also had alot of cursing in it i enjoyed it but i think it should be removed from the librarie. Cause theres kids that arent of age so they should'nt read them. i dont know thats all i have to say right now other then look at what your kids read theses days you might get upset,2,1,2,2,2
4367,2,"I don't believe that we should romove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons.  This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie @MONTH1 be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see.  Life is about learnig new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere.  The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them.      If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even thought it is what many kids are reading about today.  Of coarse, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics.  If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life.  Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life.  Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read.     Also, everyone today listens to music.  We find music as a way to relax and have a good time wheather your riding in a car or at a party.  Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them.  Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today.  What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life.     Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries.  Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete.  We watch movie to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while.  No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate.       I strongly believe that romoving any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on alot of people.  You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people.  How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed?  What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore",4,4,4,4,4
4371,2,"Many people have different views on different types of things. There is not much that can be helped with that. No one can never make everybody happy. That is a major part of life. I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitiled to their own opinion.     The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that. Just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does. If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can pick out books (and other materials) that you like. You have a choice there. There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world. People are going to be mad whether they are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying '@CAPS1't judge a book by its cover?' @CAPS2, well that could also be a reason people want materials removed. They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that. Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it.      The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people. There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it. If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it? Nope. I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it. Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it. People get offended by things everyday. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem. It @MONTH1 help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily.      The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do. For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms. It takes away freedom. We are living in @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is supposed to be a free country. It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people. I got news for you. If you @CAPS1't like it, @CAPS1't read it. There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves.      No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something. The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect. Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place. People are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens",4,4,4,5,4
4388,2,"A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to",4,5,4,4,4
4391,2,"I believe that the certain materials such as books,music,movies, magazines, ect. they are here for a reason. People like them. Maybe there are some books and things that people @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not find offensive. Thats ok I'm not try to say it isn't, but you don't have to look at that book. There are so many others to pick from it doesn't have to be the first one you pick up. The objects we are talking about are our entertainment it brings us joy and many smiles. People need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachers,but through these tools. Tools is a better word for these things. It makes them have a meaning.      Children now day love books, music,movies, magazines,ect. As a teenager I can say that most of us who like music we love it. It builds our charater. People don't make books and magazines just for them to sit on a shelf and gather dust. They were ment to be picked up and look at. I also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this. Don't get me wrong I can understand were their opinon stands,but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Children,@CAPS1,and @CAPS2 all have to learn in one way or another. Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well.      If people want this is going to be a big war. Only because they are not the only people on the planet. People want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin. Next couple of years from now people will want to get rid of something else then, something else. Its just one right after another it won't stop. This just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion some are good and some are bad. In this case, my opinion I totally and completely disagree with getting rid of the tools that can inprove our world as we know it to be.",2,2,2,3,3
4394,2,"A place fill of knowleged should be a place where you can find all the news that is making the world what it is today, a person should be able to find out things from the past also. A library has many different things found in it: books, magazines, movies, and some have music. The books range from encyclopedia's to @PERSON1, the varity of books and information is to the extreme. But then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information. With all the profanity found in today's society you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library.     Books are put into a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more knowledgable. The thought of a younger person going into the older, adult area is very upsetting but then again who's to say that that individual is not allowed to read an article or magazine that has more mature type's of information or language found in them. I feel that a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read, fact of the matter is they have the right to.      Both, young and older people need to be educated in the worlds past history and the present news. One reason being to prevent things that happend in the past, happening again. Another reason is just so that they know what is going on around them and so that the individual is informed.      Libraries should have banners or flaps up saying what is in a certain section of that specific area and people can make the decision to go over to those area's or not. Things that are found 'not right' in one's eyes @MONTH1 not seem so bad to anothers, it's all in personal preference. Things should still be out for the public to read or see.     Making the choice to go into a library is an individuals decision. Fact is that the library is a place where a person should be able to get knowledge, no matter what type of information.  A person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others.",4,3,4,4,3
4395,2,I think that your parents should have to sign a peice of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it.     On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience no pornagraphic material of course but stuff that wouldnt be considered @NUM1. Kids fifteen and and older would understand. They might also have to have an adult with them.      On the other side of the library it would be more of a childrens area with child storys. It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like.      There would have to be some one in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not. It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties.     It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for there children to read a certain content of language and description. The child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent though.     I deffinately agree with Katherine Paterson eventually your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law. Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them.,2,2,3,3,3
4403,2,"What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantraum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves? Would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy? Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? I believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves.     Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely nessessary. However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! For example, I would not want my little brother reading @PERSON1 books because some chapters @MONTH1 contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it.     If you were to get books removed that were about @CAPS1 because you were @CAPS2, many @CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different.     The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints. But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win.     I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf.",4,3,4,4,4
4406,2,"Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is innapropriete for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library.     To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child @MONTH1 not be aware. I believe they're certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older.      To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they seen on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in. This could result in a huge confrontation.      Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something.      To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what @MONTH1 cause problems to certain people. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by making a seperate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it.",4,3,3,4,3
4416,2,"Is @CAPS1 Right?     Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic.     In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are puble areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions.     A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing. By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1. This is a quick and easy fix.      There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly",4,3,4,4,4
4417,2,"In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many @CAPS1 are opposed to. While libraries @MONTH1 seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be.     One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the @CAPS1 to not have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library.     A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an @CAPS2-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @CAPS3, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. @CAPS5 censorship should be applied to libraries. Having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. @CAPS5 type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of @CAPS5 would be for a sixteen year old boy. While he cannot go and rent the @CAPS2-rated movie, if his @CAPS1 deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. @CAPS5 gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. @CAPS5 same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library.     Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' @CAPS5 is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become @CAPS5 way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. @CAPS5 ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that @CAPS5 is acceptable? These ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to. Censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives. While there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure. Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials.     These three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out at the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and the unecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries. Today's society is all about the freedom to allow anything to happen than is acceptable. While some @MONTH1 see these books or movies as their own freedom to speech the truth is that it is harming the society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to movies, books, magazines, music, and video games. Removing the offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in libraries around the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up in, and a society where things such as drugs, alcohol, and sex aren't condoned near as often",6,5,6,6,5
4419,2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional. As @CAPS1, we have certain @ORGANIZATION1 that we are guarenteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy. If the right to pick what liturature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today.     In the @CAPS2, the @CAPS3, and the @ORGANIZATION1, we are given certain @ORGANIZATION1. Some of these @ORGANIZATION1, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been contricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place. We @MONTH1 not have 'lost' these @ORGANIZATION1, but they have definitely been constricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat?     Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples on why censorship of written liturature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writting a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as 'too graphic', what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper. But by censoring our libraries, and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of it's countries youth.     Some @CAPS4 classics are also being speculated against. The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2 has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult. During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common, and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern day societies. But because time has changed it's meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, an @CAPS4 classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language'.     Censorship is not only taking place in written liturature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parents right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers.     Music is one of the biggest part of our society today. With the invention of iPods and @NUM1 devices, music has become much more common, and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it @MONTH1 seem offensive to some citizens, but others @MONTH1 just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say 'No, you @MONTH1 not listen to that,'? This should not be allowed, yet it is.     How can one person, or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the @ORGANIZATION1 of our great countries citizens, and the @ORGANIZATION1 of individuals like yourself.                                                                 Sincerely,                                             @PERSON1",5,5,5,5,4
4420,2,"It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Although there are materials that @MONTH1 me harmful to children, freedom of information is far more importiant than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors.     The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 states that freedom of speech, religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 grants freedom of expression. Censorship is effectively unconstitutional. It prevents freedom of expression. Students and scholars alike cannot access all information that should be avaliable to them if not for censorship. Although private business and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that permit this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor.     Censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' @CAPS5 a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, you cannot effectively learn anything. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Author Katherine Paterson said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS6 this is true. If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left. There will be no knoledge left. Withought knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark.     Many books are banned that address great problems of society. @PERSON3's @CAPS7 @NUM1 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the fireman @CAPS8 @PERSON4 burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored. Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend theire special interest, that is censorship. They feel powerfull when they restrict other people's freedoms. A novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS9 @CAPS10, was banned. Apart from vulgar language in the book, @CAPS9 @CAPS10 also denounced free will and portrayed the US's brutal bombing of @LOCATION1 in @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS15. This book reveals much about human truth, yet it was banned. How will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned?     Censorship is a great problem. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatently unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and censorship hinders societal change. Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our inteligence and liberty.",6,5,5,6,4
4421,2,"Children are our future because when I am old they will be the ones who are caring for me, so for me censorship is big deal for me. It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children, but because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an importaint issue but to what extent should it be taken. People should have the right to read what they want to. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries.     My veiw on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the book shelf. I can understand censorship to an extent, but taking books out of a public libraries makes it hard to chose where to draw the line. You don't want a book taken out just because it has a bad word in it. Just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't take that book out of a public library? I do beleive that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids books they most likely want to be reading a more complex book.      I think their are some books that should stay out of the library though. A example is books that are extremly racist. These books should be kept far away from are children. This is needed because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read because there are audio books and those would just make them say those things. This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet.     There is things that you can do as an alterative to keep these things out of the hands of children. There is already one that is used in public libraries and it is seperateing the adutl books from the children books. You could also move these two sections to oppisite sides of the library. the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf. Most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult.     These are my veiws and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and veiws that I have are most likely different than most people. I thought that they were good ideas though. Ones such as seperate section for kids and adults. I thought my best one was puting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther a part.",4,4,3,4,3
4425,2,"Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are to offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they they should not be read. Time and time throughout someone's life we hear things that we do not like nor want to be bothered with, but it is good that we do. Libraries should have to right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public, this is why.      We, as people of the @CAPS1 have battled through hard times. @CAPS2, racistism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to recall. Having delt with those issues we alwaying tend to repeat them out of lack of knowledge. Slavery and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were some of the @CAPS1's lowest moments and they were also very gruesome. Recalling those memeries is difficult but something that needs to be done; if books were to be cencored then many young adults would not be educated and could repeat such horrible actions.      Pertaning to movies, music and magzines the same laws applies. Though not in the same way, many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life. Music is a form a expression and everyone has their own taste. Not having to opition to chose froma variety of styles is wrong and unfair.  Music can not only be an expression feeling about love or angry but it can also teach life lesson's. Some artist like to sing or rap on their life journey. This can educate others in to knowing that if you do this then this is the result, good or bad. In a magzine they tend to lean towards more current topics such a politics, jobs, or young adults lifestyles. Movies apply to the same rights and topics. Each on is egualily as important and if a group of citizens feel that it is not then who are they to make that call.      What gives a group of people the right to say this is inapporicate and that you should not read it? They do not have it. In the constitution is states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose. By censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author right to speak. Now, that is unfair.      Though Katherine Paterson made a vaild point in saying that some books are to offensive to read, she just simiply is not right. A library is supposed to be a place where people can find a book, music, movie, magazine of any genre  and read it. If matericals were cencored then that is unfair to someone else who does want to read it. Bottom line is that you have free will and you have to power to choose weather or not you want to read something",3,3,3,3,3
4431,2,Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of.  What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books?          My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it.  I think they should have a childrens section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem.  If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them.  That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that there parent wouldn't approve of or allow them read.     If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it.  Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf.  They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want there children to see it because there children would need there permission to check out the book anyways.     I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or there parents would not approve of,3,3,3,4,3
4436,2,"No book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. Books are a very important part of most peoples daily lives. Whether they are used for school or just entertainment they are used for a good purpose and are always helpful.      People have different likes and interests and everyone wants to be able to read what they want without having to worry whether the books will still be on shelves tomorrow. For some people books are a great past time. They help you learn and even help with hard life situations. Books are the world to most people and without them those people would not know what to do with their lives. No one should be aloud to take something away that is important to other people even if it is offensive.     All books have a purpose and a message that they want to get out or else the authors would not have taken time out of their lives to write them down and have them published. The author writes to tell people a story whether good or bad, he or she wanted to get that story out there to inform people. The stories are obviously important to the author and important to the readers that enjoy their books. The authors should not be punished just because someone is offended by what he or she wrote. If people are so offended then they should just stay away from the books that the certain author writes. There are plenty of books out there and many different authors that the person can choose from. They do not have to take it out on certain authors just because they did not enjoy what other people might.    There are so many books out there and odds are there is always going to be a book that offends someone. If we get rid of every single book that offends people then we are not going to have many books left, and without books we have nothing. Books are the key point to education and most peoples daily lives. We will not learn the new ideas that authors put out there for us if people just keep getting offended and taking them off the shelves.     Books need to stay on the shelves. They are important to everyone, whether they want to admit it or not. Without books people would not be where they are today",3,3,3,3,3
4442,2,"A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book. After an hour of searching I decided on one. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out. As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material. No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experiance, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must.     Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated-@CAPS1 movie. I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music. @CAPS2 literature is not necessary and innapropriate for any age. The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations.     The world has set their standards too low, and the children of todays society are following after our footsteps. Author, Katherine Paterson once said,     '...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come.     Everyone has their own opinion and @CAPS2 is mine. As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer. I had to step-up and say something. I am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way. The first step to changing that is to set the standards high. Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves. If libraries censor materials, then next time I wnat to find the perfect book, I will.",3,4,3,3,3
4443,2,"Every individual has their own opinion on censorship. Some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. I'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored.       Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines. Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that arent appropriate for school hours or even in the school building. Schools @MONTH1 not want something inapropriate on their shelves where students can see it. Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools. Younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully. Younger kids, such as elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read.     In public libraries, things are a little different. Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out. Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. If the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book.     A couple of times, I've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense. When I got home and began reading it, it turned out I was wrong. The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read. So, I returned the book to the library. Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book. So, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out.    Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship. I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored. In other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed  to checked out.",3,3,4,4,4
4453,2,"Children all around the world find themselves wandering through the library every day.  These children are exploring the literature world to learn and grow.

I think that it @CAPS2 normal for parents to feel this way but it @CAPS2 @CAPS1 neccesary.  Children should have the right to explore the literature world however they want.  Reading different types of literature @CAPS2 a terrific way of learning and library shelves should @CAPS1 be stripped of the books occupying the space.     There are many different types of books, movies, magazines, and music on the shelves in a library.  These are all great forms of literature and a way of learning different things.

I wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not so maybe depending on what the offensive information is tells them something shouldnt be brought out",1,1,2,2,2
4478,2,"Books should be removed only if they are found a certain degree of offensive. Some other books, though, are meant for educational use and not meant to offend anyone. People sometimes take it too seriously. Many books have posed a great educational source for many years.     Books have been around for a very long time. People many years ago used to read books on scrolls, or even in pictures to tell stories. Stories have been around for a very long time and are meant to be stories, not criticised pieces of work to put down other people. There are a lot of books, however, that have been meant to put other people down. These books I agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races.     A good book that demonstrates it is not putting others down but sounds like it might is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'. This book has been intended for people to read it and learn of the life back when there was slavery or, a time just after slavery but where people did not respect the newly freed men. Another book that tells of times during slavery is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. This book tells of a young boy that runs away to live his old life and meets up with a runaway slave named @PERSON1.This book has been meant to tell of what slaves would be punished by if they were caught.     Many other books exist as these. But I guarentee that over ninety percentile of books are meant to be used for educational purposes due to the context they have been used in. Most people will take books the wrong way, but that is only because they are afraid that they will be judged, just as the book was judged by its cover. I have read many books over the past couple years, and I find that many of the books that I read have proved to be educational to me.     There are some books though, that I agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive. Censorship has a job to protect us from many unnerving topics and I agree that certain books should be taken off the shelves. But, I think that sometimes, places go over the top with censorship and should let certain people decide which books are right for a place, as well as movies. The world is maturing, even as everyone speaks, and people are learning all the time. There should be some censorship in public places, but only on over-the-top topics where authors have written about an issue that will offend many people",3,3,4,4,4

That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose.          How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray.      I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done.   Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persausion. It @MONTH1 cause trouble but just set your mind to it and you can help and solve problems when you do set your mind to it",3,3,4,4,4
4481,2,"Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship the people who rent or buy the items should. The @CAPS1 has an idea of what is offensive but they shouldn't be able to make that decision. If the @CAPS1 wants buisness they should try to make sure the customers are happy. Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants.     Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc. The different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all. If the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the @CAPS1 and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items. A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the @CAPS1 or people claim them to be.    Another possible solution would be to jus rearrange the area's of the books into to main category's such as offensive and none offensive, and then break it down into their specific categorys. So the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the librarys opinions and then go on from there. The surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the @CAPS1 to it's online website. The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off.     Now the @CAPS1 needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. So if the @CAPS1 feels that a book is offensive they shouldn't have the right to censorship. All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now. Think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the @CAPS1 in the first place.     So in conclusion the @CAPS1 should have know right to censorship books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have. This would cost time and money which they don't have. Customers could possibly stop comming in because of the change which would be a loss of money. Now everyone knows a big loss of money could hurt any buisness and possibley bankrupt them, or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover and no buisness wants that. So the easy way to make sure that doesn't happen jus leave everything the way it is",4,4,3,4,3
4487,2,"There a lot of things to life and sometimes we do need as much help as we can get. Sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it. Because when people feel lost it's the most scraest thing to a person. So they turn to reading books, listening to music, watching movies, also looking and reading magazins. But although thats not the best way you can go there times when you need to listen to your soul the most.     Now there was a time when know one knew how to read or even was a loud to read. But now adays reading as taking over. If you can read you can do anything , you could be the one to run to whole world one day if you read things right.      Books and magazins there are is not a big different between the two. Books can take you mind off some where that you  have never seen before and places like the wild, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1's, and high up and trees. It teaches you @LOCATION1 thing  but not every thing it teaches is good. Books can lie about whats about to happen to the world. Now magazing show you what all the starts are doing and how there living and what there house looks like and there money their begin home. There one thing you have to understand you can't always get scraed and thing what you reading is right you have to read your mind it see what it says about what you just read.     When you hear your favtor song what do you or when you see your favtor movie? Do start dancing or do you cry when they break up, do you say I can sing like her or do you rein act the part in the movie. These things can help you or make you think about things you shouldn't do to people or even to yourself.     Music can make you think about what your life has been throw or miss the person that  has died because they listen to that one song so much. Music can talk you in to killing yourself drive you crazy, hurt your soul when hear what someone else has been throw. Its all about how you take the song when you first hear it and take the messages out of it.     Movies show history and show you want happens to people when they do the wrong things what will happen to them. There could be a ican in the movie your watching and could want to be like him/her. But not everyone you see you shouldn't want to be like them. You have to be yourself at the end of the day. Because you wake up looking at you everyday and love you everyday and take care of you everyday.     When it's all said and done you have to belive in yourself and  not listen to what everyone is trying you. Go with you soul. Yes listening to it or read or even watching ir but just remember flow your deams and do what you love. So thants what I thing about music,books,movie and magazing listen but don't listen at the same tim",3,3,2,2,2
4490,2,"Censorship can be considered as a major problem.  I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch.  Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend.  Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong.     First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone.  I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today.  So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral.     Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored.  My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses.  If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves.  Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting.     Lastly, censorship is a communist trend.  Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy.  So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race.     So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere.  It is a very communist thing to do.  It infringes our rights.  Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored",4,4,4,4,4
4491,2,"Throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur.",3,3,3,4,3
4494,2,"Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea.      People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea.      As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me.      For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in. So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interrests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library",3,3,3,4,3
4496,2,"There are many different kinds of books in the library. Not all of them are for the eyes of every person out there. I think that libraries should censor the books, movies, and magazines so that either they are in a certain room where only adults can see or get them, or they are not in the library at all. The books in the libraries can have some very obseen items in them that young children should not be able to see.     I have been to the library many times, whether it be by myself or with others. I know what is out there and some of the books or movies are not always kid rated. I would like to someday beable to take my own child into the library knowing that what they are going to see is okay for their eyes.      Magazines are always talking about new relationships or this person is having a baby or anything along those lines, and I don't want my child seeing that. The library I usually go to has the magazines out where everyone can view them and I don't want this for my son or daughter who is of a young age. I think a parent should be able to take their children into a library knowing that when their child runs up to them with a book, it will be something that they are aloud to read or get and not something that an adult would read.      Libraries could always make a seperate room for books and movies that are not always for children. Such as the rated @CAPS1 movies or books that are inappropriate for young children. That way when a little kid is running around looking for a new book to read, they can't see or pick up these books or movies. I don't know about the other adults or parents out there, but I sure don't want my little kid walking around talking about an inappropriate book or movie they saw at the library.     Since libraries have many different kinds of magazines, books, and movies, it is not always a safe place to just let your child roam around. Libraries could always make a seperate room for items like this. For the books that are for older @ORGANIZATION1, movies that are rated @CAPS1, or magazines such as @ORGANIZATION1. I think that if libraries did this, parents would be much more at ease to taking their children and letting them run around and look for new and interesting books to read or movies to watch",4,3,4,4,4
4499,2,"I was asked the question 'Do you believe that a certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazine, etc.? should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensice?' I would have to say no. I dont think you should be in the library to be critisizing what other people believe in. But what if you just come past a book, movie, music, or magizine that is offensive? Just ignore it.      I dont think people have enough time to be caring what other people think, even though people do it all the time. Next time you see a book that is offensive to you just walk away from it and dont bother looking at it. Everything can be offensive to anyone, @PERSON2 was completly right when she had said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...The you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think this day and age everykid knows more than they're supposed to anyways, so why cencor what they already know? What if you might like this specific series and it is about the haulacaust and it is like many different story made into one to tell about how the @CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but your not @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and a @CAPS2 happens to read it and get it taken off the shelfs cause it's offensive. Maybe he thought it was a disgrace and lies about his home country and it's making people think they're all like the @CAPS5.If theat had happened to you what would you do? Would you go looking for a new book? Or would you be upset cause you weren't able to finish the whole series? Many people things offensive every single day, when they shouldn't.      People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and it's not right. If your one to take things in books, movies, music, or magazines offensive then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time on living life rather than get upset cause of stupid pitty stuff. In music they're are certain words used that one might like to be called, but if a differnt race decided to sing about it too then he might get upset and think that he's being rasict. It's not being rasict, offenending, or directed towards you! So, just do everyone a favor and stop complaining. Now Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other children taking a book off a shelf even though it might offend some I think you need to realize that it is a good thing that, that child is still trying to read, and trying to get better at reading by reading. There are selected magazines and movies out there on shelfs of publi libraries and stores that might be offending others, but if it is offending you why are you looking or even gonna buy/check it out?     I personally dont think any books should be taken off the shelf of any library anywhere. taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading",4,3,3,3,3
4500,2,They have a book in the libary  called  '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' if you ever read @CAPS3 you might cry. When the have @CAPS3 in the basment they have him eat off the floor eat his brothers thow up and even eat warms. they beet him and thell he haves booes all over his body his dad broke his arm in two form his dad and mom fighting so much that his brothers cant  tock @CAPS3 no more so his brother called the cops and the cops came and we all were gone.           two years latter him and his brother got adopined  there  new mom and dad were good too them even thow they had six brother and five sisters  but the all got a long and the had a good live  afther there relly mam and dad died,1,1,1,1,1
4509,2,"I think that everyone has there own opinon in what they listen to,what they watch, and what they read. I belive that the some stuff can change out of the world. not from people's offense or not because there will be none left too sell if people had there points of being offensive because everything is offensive to at less one person would be offensive.     I think they need to get rid of things that causes the weak minded people will do if they see it and have it in there mind and go do it in real life getting rid of the things that can get the weak mind in trouble.     I think that every that we can change what we see or hear and change the world, and thats what the world needs to change on what we could not think of before.",1,1,1,1,1
4510,2,"I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it.Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropiate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed becasue of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch.Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overally I think it should be allowed.     Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated r movies then some @DATE1 movied thats in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most student fall asleep or just doesn't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think its foolish for teachers or administraters to think that we are to immature to watch rated r movies like every kid at school watches them at home,I believe. Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that arn't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     Well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week dont let them listen to anything than see which comes out better. Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on coarse to get my work done.SO therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated r movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should to i mean its not like we are in prison,right? So there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools",3,3,3,3,3
4514,2,"Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves",5,5,4,5,4
4521,2,"If you found a movie that you really enjoyed at the library, would you get mad if the library just tok it away and there was no other place to get it? If one person doesnt like something they see at the library doesnt mean its not educational, and just get rid of it. Just because somebody doesnt like the one thing doesnt mean another person will. I dont think they should get rid of movies, music, books, or magazines just because of one person. Here is somethings that will make you think about geting rid of all these catagories.    One thing about movies that I like are they are good for visual aids. some people are better learners if they visualize something, they can get a better understanding of the purpose or the cause of the situation and they might learn faster. Another thing about movies in the library are becasue they show you things in the movie that you wouldnt be able to see if you were just reading a book. One thing that i like personally is that when people are in movies its like you are actually talking to me like me and the actor are really having a confersation. When you look at movie it gives you a visual picture of whats going on, even if the content isnt apropreate. Thats al the reasons why i think that movies shouldnt be taken away because someone thinks that the movies are volgure and not censored.     Music is another rule that they shouldn't get rid of. Music is almost the only thing you can calm you down so that you can focus again. Another thing that music does to you, is it soothe's the mind so that you can relax and you wont bother anybody else. When you listen to music , it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from. so those are the reasons why music shouldnt be rid of.     Magazine and books are the basics of a library. If you get rid of those, then it wouldnt be a library anymore. books are the basic learning methods of education. People learn the most information  out of a book or magazine. If you take those away its like your trying to hold people back from education and knowledge that they have in books. So if you get rid of magazines and books then it wouldnt even be a library any more.     if you get rid of movies from the library then people want be able to have a visual aid as there alternative way of learning. If you get rid of music from the library, you wont be able to consintrate as well on one thing if your constantly getting disturbed by other noise around you. Last but not least if you get rid of books from the library then it would be a library anymore it will just be a place to go like any other place. The library wouldnt be anything any more. Now would you want that? thank you",4,5,3,3,3
4523,2,"Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries.     One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem.      One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2. Some students in the classroom at the time called @NUM1, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher.     Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. I have  read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it.     After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people.",5,5,5,5,5
4525,2,"Libraries have books that are short, long, and everything in between. Their are good and bad books, but that all depends on the opinion of the reader. There is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf. The books on a shelf in the library are there for everyone to read so if one is removed then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book.     Would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste any good to you? No, you wouldn't get it again. So why'd someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended it isn't right your views on something are only an opinion nothing more. Your views are not the same as @PERSON1's who lives down the street so by removing a book it is pushing your views on somone else.     In conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it. Pushy people aren't normally liked by others. Books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader. That is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf.",2,2,3,3,3
4526,2,"' Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people @MONTH1 find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem, i have only been to the library around @NUM1 times i generally rent movies. there are people who can noot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books movis and music, but at the same time there are people who absolutely love it it's their thing.      I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to. some people will say well its vulgar well the people will say that its a master peice or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines. Now music nowadays can be down right vulgar and disrespectfull, it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang related violence which has become a large problem with our children.  Libraries generally have old school music like michael jackson, The @CAPS1, and slow jams like @CAPS2-kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitatfull minds. I believe that they should not pull it off the shelfs but i do believe that you should have to be a certain age to acess these things.'",2,2,2,3,2
4527,2,"Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways.      As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives.      The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared mevery much so.     Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library.     I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries.",4,4,5,5,4
4538,2,"Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over @CAPS1? Do you think that children can control themselves with offensive behavor? Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children, if they are found offensive.       I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading. I think they should consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things. Children at young ages still have their innocence. You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch a over @CAPS1 rating movie. You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life.      You have to make a choice on whether the it's comfortable for them to view what their watching or reading! It's important to hid them so the child can not get ahold to them. Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a section for children in libraries. You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in. It should be colorful and playful as possible.      I used to watch this girl named @CAPS5. I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies. I brung a movie to watch, when @CAPS5 fell asleep. So once the clock turned to @NUM1, I put her to sleep. But little did I know she woke up and @ORGANIZATION1 me watching this horror film called @ORGANIZATION1. It gushed blood everywhere and she started to sceam! I thought I had secured her in her bedroom, to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke! I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep. hoping she didn't have any nightmares.     Please be curtious to the things youlet children read or see. You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life. I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over @CAPS1 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children",4,4,3,4,3
4539,2,"Everyone is @CAPS1          @CAPS2 person is @CAPS1, this much we can agree on. So why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc., as i pointed out before, we all are @CAPS1 so we all have @CAPS1 standards on what is bad and offensive to what is good.     When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If  picked up a book on why @CAPS3 is the right religion and i am a @CAPS4 then more then likely i will find it offensive. Yet if i gave that same book to a @CAPS3, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the @CAPS4 read and find it not offensive at all. It all comes down to the veiws we all have about everything so why would you let one person or even a small comittee set standards on library censorship for they @MONTH1 feel one way while another comittee or person feels completly @CAPS1. Everyone is @CAPS1 and feels diferently about issuses. There is no way to make sure that @CAPS2 book in the library won't offend a single person.     The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect. No matter what we do, some one will be offended. For example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a @ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive. All acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. I have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc. that we @MONTH1 find offensive.     In conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive. So why then can't we just not read what offends us, this really is the only way to keep from offending  people. For these reasons, I feel that there should not be a cencorship in libraries",4,4,3,4,4
4544,2,"My opinion on this would be that , they are going to learn about @CAPS3 anyways so why take @CAPS3 off the shelfs ? No I don't think any adult material should be cencered . You know when your little girl or boy as about what they have in there hand , simple just take @CAPS3 from them and say '@CAPS1 your eyes can't handle .' @CAPS2 , they are going to ask questions and @CAPS2 , they will start to wonder , but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal ?      If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them '@CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide @CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find @CAPS3 . I mean , when you was a child , of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into there room and looking threw there stuff , but then again , you would yell at them for having @CAPS3 when they got older . So don't disaplin your children for @CAPS1 they 'stummbled' on to , you should learn how to hide your stuff better . I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need @CAPS3 ?) but , as a student looking into the future , I have a opinion .     Now lets say that you have a couple of maginzines under your bed and your child happens to see them . @CAPS2 they will start looking at them , and some words might come out , but that does not mean they did @CAPS1 wrong , @CAPS3's the parents fault . Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but , then again , I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life , I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need .     So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not suppose to see , check your room , hide your stuff so you wont be the embarassed one . No , a library can have whatever they want , @CAPS3's not your place to say what they should get ride of and what should stay.As a student , I stand up and say , No , adult material should not be banned from library's , then you would here the adults complaining and that is @CAPS1 we don't need .",2,2,2,3,2
4545,2,"The question was asked 'Do you believe certian matierals, such as books, music, movies, moagazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive,' No! By taking away these things, such as books, music, magazines, or movies off the self, that @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' your taking away things that people enjoy. Not many people including me would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these. So should we do this, I dont believe that we should. There are many reasons that this should not be passed.     First by using this censorship, you might lose more customers in that store selling these such items. Once the store has lost customers, they lose money, then they might even lose their store. A lot of people like things that dont have any limits to them. They often find their joy in these things. I know that i, myself like reading books, listening to music that has no limits. So if your taking them away or puting limits to it, are people really gonna want to have these things?     Secondly, if there is really an issue with books and etc, that are not suitable for kids, then put the books and etc,  in catogories. These catorgories would put the things not suitable for children, apart from the ones that children should be reading. Since there are no real solutions besides banning these items, this would be the best plan.      Finally, as katherine paterson stated 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self.' If this is really a problem then the the parents need to watch what their child is reading, because it isn't right to have everything taken away from the society just because the parents are concerned with what their child is reading.      So what do you think, should this be such a law. The choice is yours. Just remember though, if you agree with this then. Just think of everything you are taking away from other people, do you really want to be that heartless?",3,3,3,4,3
4548,2,"No,I dont think that certain books,music,movies,maganzines should be taken off the shefls.If stuff like that gets taken off then there will be nothing good to read the book now day a starting to get good so if they take the good book then no one will read.Most people think that rap music is bad but that is the music that most people listen to now day and mosy people dont like country.There are some bad movies out there but they are fun to watch becaues there ether funn,gross,or they are sad but there bad movies are groess or funn.       If people made better magazines then they wouldnt have that much money then that buissness will go out of buissness and that not a good thing because the  person that runns the buissness will have no money to feed his kids.Sence i have been alive nost of the good thing like books,music,magazines have changed because people dont like the stuff from a long time ago. If they do it again then people will  stop going to the movies and buying books so that wht i think.     Now there are alot of good movies and music coming out so if they brought back all the stuff they use to have then people would have more money.Why people would have more money is because more people would go se the movies from back in the old days.So like movie like from @NUM1 and even @NUM2 would make a lot mof monoey.     So that why i think they should not take stuff off because that is how we are loseing all hour money.The people are useing the that they would for movies or books and stuff they are useing for drugs and other stuff that can get them sent to jail and stuff",1,1,1,2,1
4551,2,"This essay is about cenorship for the libarys well their shouldn't because alot of this stuff is on tv like comedy centreal, @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3,mtv and alot of channels.     should music be cenorship no because the blanks can ruin the beats, rythem, and the lyrics. The cenorship ruins how the song goes and it makes people mad because they like a certain song but if they want to listen to it they have to get on a computer. Websites they can get on to listen to it is @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and alot more.     Movies shouldn't ethier its the parents pick if they didnt want the kids to watch or hear the things they do dont pick it or tell the kids to go to their rooms.     Books!!! should not i repeat should not be cenorship because what if the adults want to read them. That aint fair for them cause all of this is a about kids. Kids are smart about this they know what to read and what they shouldn't read.     T.V. shows! is best thing ever their alot of shows thats funny,awesome,thriller,and alot more. But its gets to you. Here a example @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, and more plays alot of good movies but since they have block out the words and parts of movie it really dont make sense to watch it because their not parts they really haved seen and they have to go rent it or buy it. To see the movie. Am i right?     All i am saying the cenorship ruins alot of tv shows movies and music and nobody wants that. It's ruins the enteriment for people and that sad to see cause actors, music writers, writers, and alot more speanded alot of their time for the fans and work. When they can be with their familys!!! Well this is the end of my essay",2,2,2,2,2
4562,2,"Censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around. As expressed by Katherine Paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unexceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that he or she deem unexceptable. Everyone has an individual view of what is unexceptable, so that @MONTH1 leave no book to be left on the shelf. In saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to keep them from banning all that is there. There is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government @MONTH1 not see it a something to be censored. This brings up another question, what deems something unexceptable to be viewed? In my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon? I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. It is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material.      The government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time. The novel, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' was onced censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers. If this work were to remain banned, this canon of american culture, the effect that it had on american literature to this day would have been lost.      I see literature as another form of art. Art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society. Artists are ones to take risks and so are writers. If people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? Developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as risk. Should we have censored them?     Another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the @CAPS2 regime. Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under @CAPS3's rule. A whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed enexceptable just because he did not like them. Now, should we put the power of picking what is unexceptable into the hands of one group of people? Whole generations of books, music, etc. could be at stake under such principles. There should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation.      The government, with the ability to censor libraries, can hinder our exposure to ideas unknown to us. Lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it. Who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature? Nothing stopped them from banning 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1,' so is there limit? This is the question one has to ask themselves, to keep the government from potentially cutting the nation off from future masterpieces.",4,4,4,4,4
4563,2,"There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently. Many books, movies, and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive. There are, however, libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive. There are many reasons as to why items are censored or not censored, but libraries should not have to censor certain items.     One reason why offensive material should not be removed is because material that is considered offensive could be given a label that warns people of the material in the book or movie. If a child tries to check out a book or movie that has a warning label, they would have to have a parent with them to approve the item the child is getting. Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents.     Another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting. If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they could restrict them. If the item doesn't seem too harmful, they could allow it. That decision, however, is up to the parents.     Books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library. Children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision. And that, again, is the decision of the child's parents.     There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned. That sort of material, however, should have restrictions on who should and should not check them out.",3,3,3,4,4
4574,2,"Where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3     @CAPS4 up noone wanted to read, it's to hard or I don't want to. The best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine. Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public.     We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same way with the media. Books, magazines, @LOCATION1, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best wat to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come.     Censorship @MONTH1 just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. Atleast the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today.     With all of these new @CAPS5 (Music @CAPS6) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on @CAPS6, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like @CAPS5 don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other.     Books are another thing that could use some censorship. @CAPS2 teacher used to tell me, '@CAPS8, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be.     With the world today, it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3",3,3,3,3,3
4575,2,"Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not.     What is too offinsive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.     If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.     People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways.     All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come.",3,3,4,4,4
4580,2,"Yes, I do think so because everyone has an opinon to say and its something people like to look at or leason to. Now it would be diffeint if it was a childerins book store like if they have music like christin bible songs or desine movies in the store but not to have grown-up stuff.     I really do not see the big deal if they are out because everyone likes reading somthing differint. I think as long as your reading whats it matter what it is or as long as your learning something.      I do not think u can get stuff out like movies and magazines because people like to read them to much or leason to music. So it shoukld not really matter what or where they go if you ask me",1,1,1,1,1
4581,2,"@CAPS2, I do believe that book, music, mvies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are taken offensive. Poeple should not be putting stuff out there if they are making others feel not happy about what they do. Althought, we might think that putting stuff in papers and on movies, don't hurt people. Well guess what they do     @CAPS1 of all, movies that have stuff to deal with sexual relationships. For example, gender marrage, they say that people should not marry the same sex. They make fun of them because they are not like others and they can take that very offensive. Very little people like being with the same sex. By us putting them in book, on movies, or making song to make them feel offensive is not the best way to go.      Another one is about special needs, movie or book that have to deal with people putting down others that have special problems. Although, they don't show that thier sad it don't mean that we didn't offened them in a way. Families that have a special needs child, sister, brother, mom or dad don't like it very much when someone outs something out there about their problem that they @MONTH1 have. Also, they will feel really upset and sometimes can get mad for that.     Most importantly, books or movies making fun of people that don't have a lot of stuff. It's not their fault that they don't have the money to buy stuff like others. For example, a nice house or nice clothes, most families have problems trying to pay rent and do other bills if only one parent is working. A lot of parents that work are gettin laid off are not even gettin paid for it. Worst of all, a famliy member (like someone who lives in the house) @MONTH1 have to go to the hospital and whe you go to the hopstial you have to pay for the bills. Some families are in and out of the hospital year after year and they don't have the money to pay for new stuff for the house or the people who live in it.     In conclusion, @CAPS2. i do believe that they shoukd take certain books, movies, mafazines, ect., off the shelves because they can be taken offensive. We don't know how rude it is to have something out there that makes fun of someone in a way until it's to late. Many people really don't like it when they see something out there thats offensive to them. They don't know how to react about it and they get frustrated",4,3,3,3,3
4586,2,"Should we censor the materials in libraries?  Some people believe that some of the books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene.  This could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library.  Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us.     Books have been around for centuries.  They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world.  Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times.  Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries.  By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech.  Also, technology is rapidly advancing, and sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct.  With all of the new devices we have @DATE1, people can just get their books online.     Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world.  Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellanious topics.  With that said, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content.  This is a reason on why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned.  By getting rid of magazines, you take away company's freedom of press, which is a major issue.  Refering to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the @CAPS1.  That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries.     My final discussion is music.  Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things.  Music is something everyone can relate to.  No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, music artist, or genre of music that you prefer.  By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either.  Taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture.  We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy.  Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries.     In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it.  Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people.  It is true that with technology that libraries @MONTH1 eventually become extinct.  Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials.",5,5,5,5,5
4598,2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern:          As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be comprimised.     People these days though. must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been. I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were. Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established, censorship shouldn't be up to a organization, but instead to the person viewing it. In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch? Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide?      Why should censorship exsist in our media if it doesn't exsist in our everyday lives? There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing, it's all in how you take it. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life.      Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech. If you don't like something you're seeing, then look away yourself",3,2,4,4,4
4611,2,"What if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive? Would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? Every year tons of @CAPS1 visit libraries in search of a good book, threw act of observations and personal appeal. Everyone has a different choose in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non-offensive material.     Being a teen i've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many i choose to ignore it. Reasons for ignoring it are rather simple, everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as we'll as personal life experiences. Because, everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not. Personal experiences i've had in the library are from race seeing books that relate to the days of slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to me. But, a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else. So, does that mean it should be taken down off the shelf because it is offensive to both people?     Books have diffent tones weither its on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways. I've observed plenty of times where someone feels uplifted from reading a book. Where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible. Take a magazine for instance, one reader could look like that beautiful women in that magazine and feel great about themselves. While maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like there not beautiful or self worthy as the women in the magazine. That overweight women could feel offended, while the other women feels amazing, because of that simple reason it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views of what offends them and what doesn't.     Everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them. If a book, magazine, or movie comes across as offensive then that reader probably won't pick it up to find out more about it. When i come across material in a library that is offensive to me i won't read it. Although i have picked up books that didn't come across as offensive, but after reading the material come to find out it was offensive. In response i simply returned the book and chose another one.     If i walked into a library and saw a book that was offensive to me i wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf i would simply ignore it. Everyone has different views on what offense them so there's not much you can do except just ignore it. If the case was that if a book were to offend someone and it was taken out of a library due to just that there would be no real need for a library",3,2,2,3,2
4618,2,"To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 I am from @ORGANIZATION2. I do agree that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. If they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves. Many of the books that children, teens, and adults read is a cause of a lot of violance and threating.That's a major cause these days and we want a clam a peaceful world.     Many of times we see teens to childern get into fights or have bad mouth to others. It's not a good thing to see and its mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show about negtive things or reading a book or just trying to act cool. If we could put more important learning books, movies, and ect.. there would be less aggression in the world. Having a more positive day and going out and saying I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear.     Teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing. Knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling. Now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to. You really dont cause they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get into. That's really not good for them they should always learn about the good things to help them in life. It's a tough world out there for these kids and they should be taught the best way that they can",2,2,2,2,2
4627,2,"I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read.     If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books.     There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay.     Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all.     The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw.      In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed",4,4,4,4,3
4634,2,"I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. First, you have to consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the people to determine if it should be sensored or not. People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. If you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable.      Things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence. Some people @MONTH1 not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive. In my personal experience, I tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but I do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word. Many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously. The movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie! It just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong.      It is either your own responsiblity or a parents responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true. So most children movies and books are appropriate, and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle. If you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age. Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life. It comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age.      The idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastarous. The reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature. One person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive. There would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove.I once read To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book. This book has many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature. These parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools, and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech. The parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book. Taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well. Literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture. There have been so many movements over time, many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people. Censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devestating.      You should look at your own life, and think about what you find offensive. Then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone. Almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own resposiblity to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child. The shelves should stay full of books, movies, music and magazines. It is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture",5,5,5,5,4
4635,2,"Censorship in libraries is good in some ways.  People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books.      Things that offend people: for instance, a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or natives and how they were treated so poorly. But almost anything now days offends peoaple and its rediculous. either way there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive.     My expirience with this situation it really didn't bother me. But I was in a library glancing through a book and I read a paragragh and it had the word, 'nigger,' in it and I found it a little offinsive. That word just really isn't nice.      People like different books movies magazines ect., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well im pretty sure some people find them offinsive in some way. What some might find offinsive, others might think different. Like in magazines my aunt finds them offinsive because of the bathing suit modles in it for addvertising a new swim suit. or for addvertising liquir.     All together, just about everything is offinsive to somone out there. If all the things that people found offinsive was to be removed, then there would hardly be any books movies ect., and not only that it would suck all together",2,2,2,3,2
4644,2,"Libraries are normally a safe quiet place for people to go set down drink a cup of coffee and read a book/magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of there favorite music.  But, some people don't use it as that.  They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people that are trying to have some time just to them selves while there children are away or had a bad day and to regroup and get ready for the next day. But then we ask our selves why do people want to set at a library and read.  Why can't they just check out a book, cd, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library?     I don't see what the big deal is to this! Most counties have a public libarary.  That is meaning they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at there stuff.  Yes, I can see libraries making the person checking out a book sign a letter or document, giving personal information as in a telephone number, address, or credit card number.  The letter would be saying that they have this much time with this book and they needed it back on a certain date or else they need to bring it back in a get it renewed so they can't accuse of anyone stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer.  Most places have what they call late fees.  Normally, if someone has a late fee then you aren't going to get that book back because they don't want to pay it so I feel as if giving them a credit card number they can just keep charging there account and get the money that way for the late fees. Because they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they recieve in the mail from the libabry in the trash.      I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never ending process with certain people because some of them just don't care.     Yes, the internet would be a little diffrent because not everyone has money to get the internet at there house.      I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junkey.  My ideas to me are good ideas and I feel like we can put Libraries into good use around this county and @LOCATION1",3,3,3,4,3
4645,2,"People find things offensive everyday. It is just a matter of life. Some people have a right to feel offended for some reasons, but they really can't control it from happening. It is just something that has occured for thousands of years. And people have slowly began to deal with it.     So therefore, i believe that books and other materials that are found offensive should not have to be taken down because it offends someone, because taking it down could offend someone else. What i'm really trying to get across is that no matter what, not everyone will be happy. Life is filled with mixed society and emotions, so not everyone will agree on the same thing. Also it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material. Because they did pay for it and have a right to let people in society watch, read, or listen to it. Thus being said, i believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum. Such as racism, it seems as though rasicm impacts alot of the country still today. And will forever be an on growing matter in problems around the @CAPS1.          In conclusion, i believe that the library has a right to own books or movies that are somewhat offensive. Because like i said everyone deals with it at one point, and not everyone can be happy. And some of the material is most likely educational and teaches us about the history of the @LOCATION1,@CAPS1, ect, rather than being racist or offensive as everyone jumps to conclusions about. And everyone needs to get past the offensive side and get to a level where everyone sees eye to eye. For we are all the same, but yet, still broken up among looks and culture",3,3,3,3,3
4664,2,"I think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library. If a book is published then it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in the libraries. If a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it?      I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library. If someone dosen't like it then they don't have to get it. I beleive that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own store, but why would they waste the money in buying the book.     The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books. Everyone has different views also. If anyone could remove  books from libraries then there wouldnt be any books in the library.     A book is a book. Not a criminal so why remove books from libraries? If a book can be published then it can be put in libraries. There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because its been published so it's already open to the public.",2,2,3,3,4
4665,2,"I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended all the time but do you see them trying to get what ever it is that made them fell like that. I have been offended by cartoons before but you don't see me crying about it you just have to suck it up and go on with life. Cartman from the tv show @LOCATION1 is the most offensive characters on that show. He uses every offensive language known to mankind.      He makes fun of all the racees, he says he hates everyone equally. But still you can't stop it that is like trying to get a dog to be a cat it just wont happen. It is also like trying to get rid of racecism. That is what I think about finding something offencive.",1,1,1,2,2
4667,2,"Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines.     If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend.     Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life. Than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.     I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive.     Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it. I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you.",5,5,5,5,4
4677,2,"Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library. Parents have different views on books, music, ect. One parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with one book that has a few curse words in it but another parent might think it is not something they want their children to pick up and read then later on start using that kind of language. But if the libraries censor that book and is taken out of the library it would make a big impact on people because, what if somebody really likes that book but since someone complained about it, it is now not allowed in the library. The library would lose people because of books being censored.     Everybody might not agree on different subject and they would want a certain book, music, movie or magazine censored. But if one person complained and the book is no longer there does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on. A person who @MONTH1 not have children might say, '@CAPS1 one little joke can hurt.' A joke not suitable for a child under @NUM1 to read, hear, or watch. But a parent might get upset that their child is hearing, reading, or even seeing these things and might band it from the library.     When a student @MONTH1 need to go to the library to go look up their topic they must research for school and can not find any or even good books on that topic because someone who thought the book was offensive has been removed from the library. The student might get frustrated and would not know what to do and would have to get most to all of their research off the @CAPS2. What if their teacher/proffesor said that they needed more then one source and all their information can not just be off the computer they need a book, magazine, or newspaper source also. But since that topic they are researching about has upset someone they are not able to find the imformation they are looking for.      Yes, there are some books, music, movies, magazines, and sometimes newspapers that are not for children under @NUM1 or even pre-teens to teens. That is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups. Still how do these section keep our children from reading something unaporite. Parents should know when they come into a library they should look for signs on the walls, if a library does not have signs that tell them what kind of section they are coming into all they have to do is grab a few books of the shelfs and read the inside cover or outside to suggest what kind of books are in the rest of that section. It should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children section has toys and puzzles in them and children theme walls.      Censorship would not only get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but it would also make our libraries empty. A lot of people have different point of views, his view might be diffrent from her view. From teens to young adults, teachers to children, parents to non-parents. Everyone is different no one person can speak for the whole world. This is why censorship would not work in our libraries.",5,5,5,5,4
4679,2,"In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read.  For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.  Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever.  Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things.",4,3,3,4,3
4684,2,"People in this common era have different appproaches to the idea of libraries.  Some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free.  Others believe it to be a place where there is danger for minors and can be very innapropriate.  These two opinions can cause an intriguing argument.     People go to the library because they want to either get away, or just to be free and grab a nice book.  There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful while browsing.  some books, although good, can be innapropriate to some ages, and that's when controversy spills.  Parents think the library is encouraging the check-out of innapropriate books, but this isn't all that true.  It's all about the placement of books, and that's what most librarians will tell you.  They didn't encourage the kid to check it out, but they have every right to.  It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person, might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background.     I think that these so-called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about, should not be removed from libraries.  There is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive; so why take them down?  I think a way we can monitor these kids to stay away from books their parents believe can be harmful to them is by making a rule stating that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections.  This will not only stop the fact that kids checkout books much innapropriate for them, but it might also make the parents stop complaining and the controversy will end.          People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place for giving children joy.  Remember, it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so.  Why complain? Find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it.  Bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child.",4,4,5,5,4
4688,2,"Yes, there are a lot of books out there that have graphic and sexual phrases, and there are alot of concernd parents out there that are worried about what the libraries are possibly letting their kids read. One good idea would be to put age limit signs in certain areas on the libraries, that dosent neccisarrly mean that the kid is goin to listen to that sign.           We all know for a fact that pornagraphy will stay away from libraries and stay were they are at right now so thats not an issue the parents should worry about. I think the libraries should be broken onto sections. Theres a kid section, a teen section, and a adult section, but i don't think that the adult section should be to far off the teen section because when we say adult books or magazines everybody expects it to be one thing, porn. It should still be some type of book with some kind of censorship to it.      There should be doors blocking each entrance to each section of books, and to get to them you to show the librarian some proof of age to be able to get into those sections, except the kid section. The kid section is a section that all kids can use, because we know that that section of books would be harmless to kids. I think that with that kind of security it would let parents to be able to be less stressed and worried for their childs safety and insecurity of the mind.     There are tons of other ideas to explore to be able to try and keep books with some kind of censorship but most of them are off the wall and rediculus. I think that musoc and movies shouldn't even be in libraries just leave those to other stores it's better to let stores deal with that than libraries. The librarian probably dosen't even know half the cds that probably get checked out anyways. So it's best if you don't have those in there at all.     Give some thought to these ideas that I just sprong at you. I personally think that having doors blocking to get to certain books would be a great plan to use, because it would block access to these areas from certain kids. Some other parents or people might have ideas of there own and it would be great to hear them or have some kind of bullitun about them around the city ofr town",4,2,2,2,2
4693,2,"I somewhat agree with taking out books,music,movie,magazines, or any other material that could be offensive to someone, because it could be racial or it could be about something that isn't appropriote for children to read. I think it just depends on the topic, maybe one thing could be offensive to one person and not the other, so people should choose wisely what they read.      It wouldn't be fair to take certain books from the shelves of libaries because people take different interset in different topics, so say one book has something in it that someone doesn't think is appropriote but another person think that book is fine, it wouldn't be fair to the other person to take that book from the shelves.  But something that I do disagree with in books or magizines that is inappropriote is pictures and comics, because children shouldn't be allowed to have access to a book,movie, or a magazine that has that type of content in it. But also I think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it.     So it depends on what type of things are in the book,movie, or magazine. Basically it's up to the person, if they don't like the criteria in any of those things then they shouldnt look into it",2,2,3,4,3
4694,2,"Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety",3,2,3,4,3
4727,2,"This is along the lines of personal thought. Some people can be happy with things ,while others disagree. Unless its racist or sexist no one has any right at all to say something can't belong. If someone doesn't like a book than walk away from it don't ponder at why its there, someone else @MONTH1 want it.     So I dont like this topic personally but i am ok with writing about it. Its not a choice just like it really shouldn't even be a choice for people to say what belongs where, unless it is rightfully owned by the individual. I know there are many things I dont like but I dont try and get things moved and banned. Its there people want to read it. Plus the person who wrote or made the object would be shot down (@CAPS1 of sadness or rejection).      Along the lines of insulting a race and/or being sexist, If that is being done in the book it should be stopped and disposed of. People have the right to say they are not happy with that but if they just dont like the topic but others do than they need to move on and not make a big deal out of it. Now if the title @CAPS2 says what the book is about than walk away don't pay attention to it. People @MONTH1 use it for research or something in the future. Now people @MONTH1 be self-centered and just want what they need so they cause a huge, @CAPS3 or fight over stupid little things. Thats the people that always got things handed to them which I imagine is why this topic came up.      So that is my thoughts and believes about the topic of Censorship. It doesn't matter where, in school or at a library it is there because someone is/was interested in the item. I know this is my thoughts and believes, people @MONTH1 completely think what i wrote it stupid, some @MONTH1 think its smart. Its just the culture you grew up in and @CAPS1 of mind you are in that current time and place.",2,2,3,3,3
4730,2,"Need help with Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1     (I chaged the @ORGANIZATION2 of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.)     To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2. Nothing really all  to serious I guess. . It seems the libaraiains there are censoring  tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1.      They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers.  There have also been some complates from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie .     To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have  already blocked all the inaproperate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school. So then I tryed to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the werid adult rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2. That way no kid will have nightmares any more.I also threw in the idea of seperarting all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child,teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3     The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw home big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundered pages of book at least. I was to scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I go to,to see if anyone else would be willing to help me.      So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article. I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists. I @CAPS8 you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing too,@CAPS8 You.",2,2,2,3,2
4738,2,"Dear reader,     Do you believe that certain book, magazines, movie, and music should be removed from the shelves of libaries if they are found offensive?  A lot of people in the world today are having this same question.  Some parents think they should be removed, but others argue they should stay.  I'm going to tell you what i think.      As a citzen,  I know some parents are arguing that certain magazines and books should be removed from the libary if they are found offensive.  Well if they do that then there wouldn't be anything on the shelves in the libary would be shut down.  I mean i see where some of the parents are coming from some of these things are offensive and not apporaite for children, but if you dont want your children to see it them keep them away from that section of the libary or don't bring them, you go get the book or magazine they want and then bring it back home for them.       In the world today everything is offensive to someone in the world i mean everyone has there own thoughts on what they think is offensive and what they don't think is offensive. So eventually if you were to take everything offensive out of the libary it would be emptied out.  I want you all to read this quote and really think about what the author is saying ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.  But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work i abhor- then you have the exact same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (@PERSON1).  I don't know about you, but this really sums it all up for me.     The truth is you cant always do what you want, you just have to live with the way it is and try to make it better for yourself and your family.  If you read this article and really listen and take into considertion what im saying i think you 'll find that it would be a lot easier for you to just act like the offensive books and magzines aren't there because if you try to get them taken out you wont even be able to go to the libary anymore.                                             sincerly the one and only,                                                                     @PERSON2",4,4,4,4,4

4745,2,"'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive.  First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive",4,4,4,3,4
4749,2,"When you think of a book do you think happy kids books, or mysterious dark books? What if I was to say offensive books? Most magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you @MONTH1 think.      When I think of a movie I want to watch I think of something that im going to injoy; not something im going to shut off in the middle of it. What if you pick a movie that @MONTH1 look good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds good but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother its the exact opposite. Do you turn it in? Do you turn it off and waist your money not doing anything about it?     Offensive books, movie, music, and magazines should be cleared from the store. If your not going to finish it, then why is it there? Im not going to watch or read a book if its not going to make me feel good as a person or make myself feel good. If people can sit there and write it, act it or play it then we should be able to speak our oppinion on it if its good or not.      People have feelings, if there going be hurt by something we should enjoy then take them off the shelves. Do something about it. We all should have the success for doing something for other people, and if not that then for ourselves.",3,3,3,2,3
4751,2,"I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' @CAPS1 repeats it's self, and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south.      What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened. And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.     The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical.          Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex? @CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.     It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors. If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman",5,5,5,5,5
4753,2,"I know that some people find some books offensive mean cruel or racist but most of the time people write @CAPS4 beacuase its what they feel or what people want to read. Books are a privlige and we should be able to use that privledge. People need to learn that its ok that books are sometimes are a little harsh. The @CAPS1 is not the most friendly place ever and books can help convay that with less hurt then  experencing @CAPS4 first hand.   I know that all books should be left on the shelfs becuase just because its offensive to someone doesnt mean that you should take @CAPS4 off. For every book someone will find @CAPS4 offensive because of somthing. If the cause is if its offensive then all books should be gone. If someone took the time to go out and write and book and make sure that everything about @CAPS4 is correct then why should we stop them from letting people read @CAPS4. They have a right to write @CAPS4 and we have a right to read @CAPS4 and no one should take that right away. If someone wrote a book on the hollocost people are very offended by that but they dont try to get ride of @CAPS4. so why should any book be different because its not a big event like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Its just seem so upserd that people who go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by @CAPS4. I think they just need to suck @CAPS4 up and move on. if they dont like @CAPS4 then dont read @CAPS4. Someone who wants to can so do not take that away from the people that want to read @CAPS4.      I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in are library and they said,'oh you cant read that because @CAPS4 was found to offencive.' @CAPS4 made me uphald that they would deciede how someone els feels about a book. @CAPS4 makes me so angry that they get to dicied how someone els feels about a book. they must be magic becuase I did not know that they know how someone els feels about a book or anything for that matter. we do have books here that are kept behind the librarians desk that if you really wanted to read that book its behind her desk. and im ok with that beacuse at least they have @CAPS4 for people to read if they really wanted to. This is what i think should happen if they have books that they think is too offensive to people. At least try to give an effert to perserve are right as citizens of the @ORGANIZATION1.     Lets throw an other aspect here about money. the book that you want so badly gone from a library was most likely payed by you, the tax payer. So you and a lot of others payed for this book and now you want to wast that money. That is just insane that you would want to wast that money after @CAPS4 being payed for. This just make me want to say wow do you really want to be that upset about a book. Does @CAPS4 make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone. Well good for you mission accomplished. All you did was get worked up and you wasted money. People just need to relize the bigger picture not just themselfs but others. In them taking down a book because you were offended, offends me. This offends me a large amount because now you ruined somthing that was not nessisary to be taken down.     This is how I feel about this subject. I am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library. If you wrote a book and people did this to you how would you feel. I know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work. People need to just calm down and smell the roses and forget about things that do not matter. Stand back and think for a second and say,'will this really effect me if i get this book taken off the shelf.' @CAPS4 also make me mad that the libary bought the book and now its gone so did the money just go to waist becuase the book is just gone. This is how I feel on the matter of getting ride of books.",3,3,3,3,3
4756,2,"Libraries @CAPS1 Or @CAPS2?         This world is like no other world but to have some of our ideas blocked because there to offensive thats obsurd. There is a lot of things that are offensive in a library such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect... But if they are so offensive to some people then why keep complaining do somthing about tell it someone. Now librarys are a place where people can relax and grab a @CAPS1 book to read it. When they stumble upon this book that is highly offensve why put it back. Say somehthing and tell the manager this book is too offensive to be in a library.              There are kids in the library maybe looking for something to read they @MONTH1 stumble upon a movie that is very inpropriate. Things like that should not be in a public library. As a @CAPS3.S citizen i belive that things like that should be removed for the shevles. Why would they be up there in the first place what is this world coming to. Some of these books now and days need to be censored. Beacuse of all the @CAPS2 words in there kids might pick up all that foul language.           How about some of this music don't you think some of the lyrics maybe be offensive to some people. When rock stars, rapers, ect... write there lyrics they don't think of what other people think of them. They just might put the most badest languege in there songs they don't care they just want the money.Thats why you should put you're foot down and say this is going a little to far why not censor some of your lyrics? Why not write a letter sstating your concerns.           Things in the librarys like books, movies, magazines, ect.. all should be checked and blacked out. Some of this shoudn't even be displayed in the librarys. There are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library. Lets take a magazine for example, a magazine has things that talk a lot about sex, drugs, and other things related to that. Some people might like it but for a twelve year old boy to pick up somthing like that and  start reading it. To me thats wrong i dont know about anyone else but that shouldn't be displayed in a library.          Now ive been to a library before they have some inapropriate things in there. But i really didn't think anything of it but when i seen a eleven year old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence that's something he might pick up on. He is seeing it in a book so why not try something in a book. Now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible.           This is all where censership comes into play by editing a lot of the things in the library. People now and days dont care but they shoud start caring more. Thats just my opinion why i think its wrong to put all this @CAPS2 stuff in a public liberary. I think this is something kids don't need to see what do you think",4,4,3,3,3
4764,2,"Debates are a main part of our society today. Everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right. Books that show how other cultures behave, that to the people being described in the book @MONTH1 seem offensive, are important because we as people need to absorb as much as we can about other cultures. Our businesses are in other countries, many people living in @LOCATION1 speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that @MONTH1 in fact be offensive to a race of people.       Businesses thrive in other countries. A lot of our countries income is from our factories and companies in other countries. @LOCATION2 is a place where much business happens for the @ORGANIZATION2. If we, as @CAPS1, can't learn about the @CAPS2, how can we learn their business methods and way of life? To the @CAPS2, these books @MONTH1 be offensive, but to us they are learning tools descirbing @CAPS2 culture.     Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to. High schools require that we learn some foreign language, even if it is only the basics. The schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force. Learning about their language and habits comes from books. The mexican population might not like the way we depict them in our stories, but this is necessary to learn about them.     In the @ORGANIZATION1, there are all kinds of freedoms that we as @CAPS1 use freely. Freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in @LOCATION1. Books are not excluded from this rule. I'm sure that other countries have offensive books about us. It's a common theme around the globe.      Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we must be able to read some books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be taken out of the children's section of the library, not banned completely. This is the same case with other populations of people. They cannot take offense to what we have to say, because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book. Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted.",3,3,3,3,3
4772,2,"Libraries have a variety of material from books to movies.  Most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want.  Some of the literature and other material you @MONTH1 find in libraries however, are not intended for certain people, such as young children.  Censorship takes material that these certian people should not read away from everyone.     Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life.  Censorship is not bad per say but it does restrict people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general catigory.  Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else.  Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness.  Everyone finds something offensive.  Just because you find something that speaks a bold statement does not mean that you should persicute someone who is intersested in the subject matter.  For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet is simple.  Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children @MONTH1 choose material approprate for their age range.     More often then not I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced.  Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading.  By not having censorship, everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like.  This also allows a variety of books to a variety of people",3,4,4,4,3
4773,2,The author is writting about taking books off that the adult's don't want the book's the  end they won't have book's to. They take out the books that have bad words or pictures in them. Well I don't really belive that they should take them out becuase they het intresting well some of them do. Well I'm not a fan of reading I dont really like reading but I have to anyway and I dont think it should be taking out.          I don't really think it should be taken out for some reasons it's better to have them so kids can read and learn bout the pictures. Some book's aren't that bad to kid's like to elementary kid's the only book's they like are the one's with picture's in them. The @CAPS1 school and middle school kid's like the chapter kind of book's and intresting book's. The parent's would like them to have educational book's that will help the kid's learn new word's and school related stuff.          The book's the adult's want are the kind that have meaning to like have alot of knowledge and school realated stuff. They want there kid's to learn about what they are reading. But yea i din't think they should take out the bbok's that they have they shoul'd just leave them for the kid's becuase there atleast are educational to them.

4776,2,"I do believe that  book, magazines, music, movies and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf.  If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think what is books, magazines, movies, music and etc., for and why are they on the shelves for if you can't read, listen or watch them. Book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed. Music should be listen to and movies should be watched.     The reason why I agree with the fact magazines and book should be taking off the shelf  is  because they were made to enterain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention. Another reason why I  think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classrooom book you  learn different thing like math, you learn about the history, or you learn about different  thing in english class.  Magazines and books were made so that  different people can  take it off a shelf  and look though it even if they only want to look a pictures if it has picture.     The reason why I think music should be taking off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, @CAPS1&@CAPS2, gospel,or @CAPS1&@CAPS2 and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person life or what goes on in their heads.Music can inspire people in different ways.Music is apart of life and most people in the world like to listen it different people that inspir them.     The reason why I think movies should be taking off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched not just sit and let in movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different thing, such as become an actor also. Movies tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored.     To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books and music off the but put them back so that other people can enjoy they thing you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies and listening to music nad reading magazines and books can help people in life and @MONTH1 also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run. Ya'll be suprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening and watching.",2,4,2,2,2
4777,2,"Different Then Everyone Else     @CAPS1 do people find small things offensive?My opinion is the everyone as their own idea of what can be offensive to them.There are so many small things the can be offensive like books, movies, and music.Its not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf the you might think its offensive. I find it a little rude to discriminate someone for thier one belonging.      Books can be a way to learned new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more then what can a person with there own words can.There are so many books the can be a little offensive to people and even kids.I know the a parent wouldn't like to have a book on the shelf  about '@CAPS2', when they are getting @CAPS2.Sure is not a nice thing to read about but, really parents think about it.Don't you think us like kids need to know what really means @CAPS2?A book can tell us the and a good way or and a bad way but we can learned from it,and you dont even have to talk about it.      Movies are similar like books,in one way the you can see it in action what there trying to teach everyone.I know the some movies are horrible just like @CAPS3 @CAPS4.Its a horrible movie to watch but really we need to know what really happened to does people. And even it a teacher is tell you have to see it with your own eyes to belive it. A good way it to watch the movie and learned from it.      Music has  a lot of ways of being offensive to people but singer's thats their way of express their own feeling about stuff.We can't really discriminate anyone for their own belives. There are so many singer like @CAPS5 @CAPS6, the use a lot of bad words in his song but thats how he get's his own feeling out to others. Even if the song is offensive to you its more of their own opinion just like we all have different opinon then others.      My opinion about feeling offensive is we all are different and have a opinion about it and we need to respect the. Especially if i wanted to learned new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me I would want a book or a movie to learned. And parents just becuase I'm reading a book, or watching a movie or listening to music  about bad stuff don't assume I'm  going to do those things I would just want to learned about it. I wouldn't like for someone to take a book off the shelf especially if i want to read it. Remember its your own opinion about the book not everyone is different then you",3,3,2,2,2
