ADF1112226F4,"Do you agree with Albert Einstein when he said ""imagination is more important than knowledge""? I think that is true because if you have now imagination than how are you going to get knowledge. I agree because Albert Einstein had to have a strong imagination to become really smart, Albert Einstein lived through a lot so he knows a lot, Elbert Einstein is smart.

To begin with, I think that Elbert Einstein had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest human beings to ever live. He was really smart that is why I think he said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he had to have a strong imagination to think and become really smart. Elbert Einstein created and invented a lot of thing and to make to things he needed a strong imagination.

In addition, Elbert Einstein was really old and really smart so he lived through a lot as a human not as genus. He also learned a lot from being a genus but he did live through a lot and he was a human.

Also, I think that Elbert Einstein created cool inventions and gadgets from his imagination he needed a wild imagination to think and create a lot of cool things that is most likely why he said this quote. He was smart but he used his imagination too.

In conclusion, I agree with what Elbert Einstein said because he had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest people, he lived through a lot, he was really smart. I think you should agree too because you can use your imagination to become a genus at you school, job or even your house o with your family. Use your imagination.",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0

Also to keep it simple it's important to have something important like this (after school club) to let the students know they have after school to help them complete there homework.

And then, if students need help on completing there homework, etc then the students can come to after school to get the help they need. And create a bond with other students by helping each other.

therefore i think there should be a after school club to help, do, and support. 3 gt",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5

I truly believe after school homework clubs are beneficial because students can study, get homework done faster, and socialize.

First off, I believe after school homework clubs are positive because students can study. Students can study what they need to if they have a little extra time at school. Many students dont have enough time to study at home and a after school club could give them more time to study what they need to. Some students need extra help understanding what is on the paper and studying could help them a lot.

Next, after school homework clubs are important because students can finish homework faster. Some students cant get homework done at home so an after school club could help them. Students can get extra help with what they dont understand at an after school club. Many students cant students can get their homework done faster by the help of other students.

Additionally, after school homework clubs are useful because students can socialize. Students can learn how to talk better to other students. Students can talk to friends when their done with their work. Many students cant talk to their friends on the other teams so after school club could fix that.

I believe after school homework clubs are an asset to students because it helps students a lot. I believe more people should agree with me.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
8CDBA4104C7E,"Identifying a career in high school helps students prepare for their future. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Committing to a career as a young age it's a good idea.

First of all, identifying a career in high school help students to achieve their goals a little earlier. For example, if they start to study and be familiar with a specific career, they can graduate early. Meaning they might not have to spend 4 years in college, as everyone else. They can probably graduate from college after 1-2 years of studying for their particular career. Since they already going to have the knowledge from the courses of high school.

Another example is, students can start to take their future in a mature and serious way. For example, those courses can help motivate students about wanting to have a better future. Meaning they can change their thoughts about not wanting to study for a career. And that they're the ones responsible for their own things. It can teach them that having a career is that important thing that it's going to take them somwhere in life.

While some people think this is a good idea, some might not. Some people think that this is a waste of time. For example, students are going to have more things to worry about. Like studying more and passing extra classes. And this can cause for students to be mentally and physically tired. So they these people rather wait until college.

However, waiting until college can be a little late because students aren't going to have enough time to think about a partcular career they want. For example, once students are out to college, they need to have the career they're going to study for. And if they don't, they could pick one that they aren't really passionate about. Which causes more years in college, or them dropping out of college. And this can cause not having a great job, or future.

To conlcude, committing to a career as a young age is a good idea. It's a good thing for students to do it because it can help them to prepare for their future. Committing as a young age help them to achieve their goals a little earlier, which is amazing. It can help them to know what to expect when they go to college. Committing as a young age for a career can help students in so many ways, and these are examples in the ways it can help. ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
331D60E145C4,"One time in high school I met a teacher who looked like a mean person and who didn't like to interact with students or explain over again the stuff that he taught, so I went to talk to my counselor about if there were any possibilities if I could change the class, but she said no. After a while of taking his class, I realized that he is a very good teacher and a very nice person because every time I asked him for help, he would always tried his best to make me understand the topic and do good on my quizzes/ test. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people say that you can know someone's character by just the first impression. First impression are possible to change because they might had a bad day, and you always have to know the character before in order to judge it.

People all over the world are always going to have bad days, and that's normal because life consists on having good days and bad days; if you're having a bad day, of course you won't have a good attitude towards people. For example, some people can have problem at their house, work, school, etc... and obviously that's going to affect on their behavior and they might treat you good or bad, it depends on the situation. When you first see someone and they seems like a bad person, that doesn't mean he is a mean person; he can just be having a bad day or something bad happened. In order to judge someone you have to know the character first.

In life you can't be walking judging people just because they did something or just by their looks. For example,The majority of the population in the whole world knows the saying ""

Don't judge a book by its cover

"" this meas that just by looking at person from his outside, doesn't mean they are going to be like that on the inside. People might look either a mean person or a good person, there is some people that look like they are a good person and that they have a nice behavior, but at the end of the story they might do you wrong and you are going to be the one losing by trusting the person by just thinking they had "" a good personality""; However, there is also the people that looks like a ""bad person"" but some of those people can be nice from the inside, and you might need help from them at one point.

In conclusion, first impression are possible to change because people might be just having a bad day, and also because after you get to know the character as they originally are, then you are going to start thinking differently about that person. It's important for you to know the character first before you start judging that person, because you never know if that one person that you rejected/judge at the beginning, can be the person that you need the most in the future.

Being confident in what you're doing is great but what if you're too confident ? Not everyone has the same definition of success; Your vision of success might be their way of seeing failure. By setting your goals low, you're taking the potential risk of not attending the necessary capacities expected from you.

When aims are set high, you are also sure to achieve your marks, have the pride of succeeding and be confident in what you're doing, this affects your mood too, therefore you are happy in how well you are doing, have the desire too do even better.

The science fair is coming up this month; Doing a project on volcanoes sounds like a good idea, you're familiar with the subject and have done it before, teachers love projects that demonstrate real life actions, all though; This idea is unoriginal and five other students are thinking the same way as you are, by doing the volcano project, you would be aiming low, you must get out of your comfort zone in order to achieve your goals. Choosing another subject for your scientific project without being boring and using a real life causes would impress the judges, give them useful information without being too specific.

By setting your aim too high you are taking a risk and could possibly fall short, but by aiming low you are closing the opportunities of going bigger and doing something you wouldn't normally do that could lead to potential Utopian future of yours.     ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5
5494132B7229,"Is better for students that are entering high school to know what they want to do after they finish high school? some pleople will say yes but some will say no and they are not wrong or right anwer in thise question is depending in your point of view and how fast you want to achive your goal and how good you want to be in your carrer and work.

The people that say yes they say that because when you know what career you want to take before entering high school you wiil choose you classes better depending in your career and what high school you want to attend because come schools have programs that count like college classes, and in high school you have only four years and that is not enough time for you to choose and you will end up in a carrer that you don't like if you choose the wrong one. If you know what you want to be you will cofus better in that career . You can join programs to help you more in your goals and when you know your goals you can achive them better. You also will try to see how can you get a scholarchip for your carrer and what college are better for you, and you will mead people that like the same thing as you and you can make friends. When you join programs some time you can get a scholarchip if you are good. For example my friend want to join the army so he is taking jrotc to help hem do better in the army but my other friend wants to do soccer for college so he is taking advance p. e. to be in shape and he is also in the school team to get a scholarchip, and me I'm taking business classes to help me know more about business marketing because I want to put my own store and Im putting everything of me to do that because that is my goal and i want to do the best of me in that project of my life.

People that say that you don't have to know what you want to be before you get in to high school. They say that you can join different programs and see wich one you like the most and you will choose your career from that decition and you will know what's about because some people choose careers that they don't like them maybe because they dind't know the stuff you have to do or they dind't expect to be like that. Is better to waste four years then wasting your entire live in a career that you don't like. you sholl try to get a scholarchip that way you don't pay for college.

If you dind't have a scholarchip and finish college and you are working in a career that you don't like and you dind't have a sholarchip you are going to be in debt and you are going to pay alot. If you only study for one year in college and you fell like that career is not for you you have to play for that year and is not cheap so you have to choose your career when you are in high school and see what's about before entering and if you like it because if you don't like that career you are going to waste your time. For example I dind't know what career I like before high school so I join jrotc and i dind't like it and a teacher told me to take business classes and I like it so I chose to do business for my career.

In conclution both of them are good options but if you know what you want to be before high school you can see what's that carrer is about in high school and if you dont like it you can change it and the other one you will have more chooses because you will not focus in only one career you will see more oportunitis. Is depending in the choose you make. All of thise dipend in how you are because evryone is defferent and not everyone is going for the same opsion. But for both of them you have to do your best in school to achive your goal and get a schoolarchip that way you dont pay for college. But first of all we have to finish high school and get good greads. and remember that is only one life so do your best and try to live the life that you want and don't let others tell you that you can't do something just belive in your self and that will be a big change adn wen you are in college do your best and do your work and life the live chill.",3.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

EFACA593A52B,"Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. According to ""

The Washington Post,

"" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important.

The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Name's goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 o'clock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job.

The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in

Village's Company

. He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Village's Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Village's Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs.

In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life.

BCF16DEB277E,"Many people can set a good example by the way the behave but you can also Influence people by the your professional career you have. I believe example is not the main thing it is the only thing because younger people growing up look up to you by the way your behavior is and they hear the kind of language you use towards friends and adults.

For example, when I was growing up I looked up to my brother I watched his actions very closely. One day I saw my brother giving food to poor people at 7 eleven and I was shocked, the next day I went to give food at 7 eleven. Eventually, as I was leaving the store the manager called me up and asked me why I was giving food out and I told him that I saw my brother giving so I thought that was the right thing to do. In another occasion my brother and mom went to the toy store to buy some toys for a birthday present for my cousin and my brother really wanted this toy so and my mom said that she was not going to buy for him so he started kicking the floor because he was mad at my mom and because of that my mom bought him the toy. So the next day my mom took me to the supermarket with her and I really wanted this snack from the shelf and she said that I could not buy it so I started kicking the floor and crying therefore my mom bought me the snack. Since I saw my brothers actions and behavior towards my mom and saw it worked out well I did the same thing.

For instance, one day I heard my mom arguing with my dad on the phone because of some misunderstanding they had and my mom was using foul language to address her part of the side and my dad was using it too. So later on in the day my mom called me on the phone and told me to go get my little brother at school and I told her it was not my problem to get him and then I started using foul language on the phone because I thought it was okay because she used on my dad. In another occasion I heard my brother giving out compliments to people on the street and by the way he spoke it influenced me to say the same thing as him as walked the streets.

Some people may argue that people get better influenced by a person of its professional career because they think they got to the place there at right now by showing they can go anywhere no matter what example they show.

In conclusion I believe that example is the one and only thing that influences others becasue what your actions do your younger sibling and friends are going to follow it and get influenced by you. the actions my brother took I followed them if though they were good or bad I got influenced by it. Also the way my mother was speaking and the language she was using towards my dad influenced me to speak back to her that way when she called me.          ",4.5,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
C6555F21F7CD,"I believe that Winston Churchill's quote,""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is true because after you make the mistake you learn how not to make that mistake again. The only way to learn how to be successful is to make a mistake. I think that you should always isten to your elders because they have been threw rough and happy days. When we are little, we always think that our parents are being really strict, but they're only trying to keep us happy.

I have made alot of mistakes when I was a pre-teen and I still make mistakes now,but at the end i realize that I was wrong. I was thirteen when I got my first phone and my parents always told me to not have social media till i'm sixteen. The only reason why my parents said,""no"", to social media was because they didn't want me to get hacked by people. All though, my parents said no to socail media i got it anyways. After couple weeks of having social media, someone decided to hack my snapchat. At that point, I realized my parents were always right.

My parents have made mistakes before too. When I waa a baby, my parents took me to my grandparents house for the first time. After we got to my grandparents home, my parents forgot to close the door behind us. So, I crawled out of the house and they didnt see me. After that, this guy saw me crawling down the streets and there were cars driving by me. So, the guy carried me to his shop to see if anyone comes to find me. After couple minutes, my mom realized I wasnt there so she ran out of the house to find me and than couple blocks down she saw in someones shop. My parents always checked if the door was closed after that incident.

Always keep in mind that you shouldnt do anything without thinking of the affects. If you not sure if its right or wrong, then you should ask someone for their opinion. If that doesn't work out than your probably doing something wrong. If you do something wrong then people will change the way they look at you. It better to keep in mind that your family and friends have faith in you.                                                      ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

The people who have positive attitude if good with the family to improve a condition society, or help to the change they attitude.

If u be honest with one and each other they would be honest with you and you guys will have better friendship with each other. it's good to be honest with your parents because if your in trouble they can help you solve the help if something is happening in school. If your not honest with people they won't trust you ever again they will think that you are a person that lies. I you think about it if you did something bad and don't be honest you will get cought for what you did and it would go how you want it to so it batter if you be honest and truthful but things because if your not it wont go your way. But sometimes being honest with people hurts and some people don't want to hurt them but you just have to because if you don't they will get there hopes up and when your honest with them there going to say thank you and that's when they are going to think to them self and say this is what i should of done from the bringing and this the people i want in my life. So some time you just got to be honest with them and they want you in there if it's okay because at lest they were being honest with and you just move on in life. Honesty is good sometimes i agree but then disagree at the sometime so base I'm trying to say that honest it's good sometimes and sometimes it's not but I rather have honest people in my life because they are telling me the truth and they didn't tell me the truth later on I would get hurt by them and I hate getting hurt by people so I rather them telling me the truth right there when i'm talking to them then founding out by other people and getting hurt and for them not being honest with you from the bringing and putting your self down after you find out. I just feel that honest it's just a good thing because it peras for the real life when you get older and have a job and a family because then your ready for all of what is going to come to you in life sometimes life is not fair to other people and you just got to be ready for it in life.,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

Well one good reason on why working with a group is a good idea my opionion is because by working in a group you can find different details on what the teacher given what to work on in a group yall can bring up all the information yall came with or got from the internt and have argument about which one should be the best answer. Another reason on why is a good idea working with in a group it's a easy way to get a better garde as a group and working in a group is really fun you get to talk and use the computer sometimes the teachers let us use our phone and we make like a little group chat for us to talk about the work she told us to do and share our answers on the group chat and see who agree with it or who don't and we all got different reasons and at the end of the day we pick the support detail and use it. My benefits of working with a group is that if you are one of them students who really want to be in a group and help people and on there work show them how smart your are and that you in the group of people you are a hard worker.,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

Online school could not only help scholars to graduate on time, but also help a portion of scholars that are looking to get a job for future education, or helping their households. Online school may also be a helpful option for scholars with disabilities, or illness that might stop them to attend school.

Although online school might be a good tool for some scholars it can also cause negative outcomes such as students not doing their assign work, or not passing the class due to less time with students. Other issues that must be faced ,are some students not having computers, or not having access to the internet to do their assigned work. Overall online school is a great tool for students that may struggle to attend school. Once its issues are met and something has being done online school may not be only a great tool for some scholars but also an opportunity to finish school without any issues.

In conclusion online school might have many issues but once its issues have being solved and students get help with access to computers, or internet it could make a big impact on young scholars. Online school may also help economy by allowing students to have enough free time to get a job to help in their households, and their future. Therefore online school should be an option in every school to help students achieve their goals, and well being                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.5
3DC539E4E871,"I believe that if some school districts offer programs that allow to graduated in three years instead of the traditional four years, It couldn't be a good idea, Because most students following this plan must take course during the summer or in the evenings.

One reason is that students may be not able to get the enough knowledge because the time in class must be less than the normal time in school.

Second reason is that even if students graduated early from high school, students won't be able to take elective course.

Third reason is that some students work during summer or at night time so it couldn't be a good a idea

.

In conclusion i can say that if some schools offer programs that allow students to graduated in three years instead of four even if it sounds good it is not a good idea, because most of this students must take the course during summer so there are some reason why it couldn't be the best way in order to graduated, including that some students may be not able to get enough knowledge, and some students have to work in summer time.",3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
615FAEE4F8EF,"School should not extend the school days more than eight hours. Some people think that spending more time at school would be a good idea because students would have more time to study. Others think that An 8 hours of school time is enough time to study every day. This is an controversial issue and school time should not be too much .This change would affect students and teachers because some students have part time jobs,students would not have enough time to do their daily activities with friends and family,teachers and students would be tired by the the end of the day and they would not do good.

Some students have part time jobs and they take some rest before going to work after school. Some students go to work right away after every school to get out early and do their homework after. By adding two hours a to the school schedule would make students who have job work till late. Even though some students need to work as much time as they can to help their families or pay something they are trying to buy. Some of this students would be also constantly tired of spending too much time at school and then going to work.

Another reason why school days should only be eight hours long and not ten is because students would not have enough time to do their daily activities. Students hang out with family and friends. Some students are part of a sport team and they have to have time to go practice. Even some students help their family to either clean or any other thing that has to be done at home. Some students have to take care of their little siblings after school because their parent have to go shopping or work. Students also need to do what they like and by doing that they would be more active.

Another reason is that teachers and students would be tired by the the end of a ten hours school day and they would not do good. Some students are already tired in the 4th hour of school. Some students do not want to do their work in the last class and some fall sleep even in a eight hours school day. Even teachers would get tired of being teaching and grading papers all day long. When it comes to a history teacher they have to talk a lot in every class and they get tired. By making every school day 10 hours long would put to much pressure to students and teachers that they would be exhausted by the end of the day that they would not be able to pay attention in their work.

School itself it hard sometimes but working and studding is even worst and those who work and study at the same time often need time time to get things done, and by spending too much time in just one thing can affect the other .Every one has personal things and activities to do and some require certain among of time.

EFB208F9EF60,"They say that conserving energy and resources, some buissness have a four day work week consisting ten houres a day. Extending the school day two houres and a four day school week ain't a bad idea for people who need's more help and are focusing on their future and college. Do you think this is a great idea? Yes, because the more time your at school the more time you'll be learning and getting help. If added 2 more houres to school on a four day school week, the more school work will be finished and learned. I think my school should fallow this model because in my opinion test and quiz scores will show a greater improvement over time.

First reason why my school should have a four-day week school with a exteded 2 houres is because, many work can be done at school and teachers would have more time to explain details with deeper nolige. Teachers could have more time to study practice with the students before taking their test like using websites like kahoot's. it/quizlit. live and notes so the students can feel confident of what they have learned. This will be consiting longer periods for every class that every student and teachers will have to make sure every student leave the school grounds successfuly and informed of what they have learned that day.

Second reasons is that being in school for 2 more houres will help you work smoothly at every class. Plus every student will be haveing a three day weeknd from Friday to Sunday to rest and to have more time to complete homeworks and to study for testes and quizies. I could get work done when i have not been in school because i was sick or on vacations to get back on track with my studies and school work. Great idea for people at school becasue they won't have any excuss of loosing or not finishing work.

First impressions are the biggest factor in the world we live in right now, because we all want to have a good life, so we have to present our self properly. When you do not show manner the first time your meeting someone they will think you do not have home training and you do not care what people think about you.

He is always happy and smiling he shows wisdom and makes other around him happy. My other person the shares wisdom and experience is my grandma.

She has share a lot of her experience of cooking I learn something new from her cooking ability she is a bit old but it does't stop her she has a lot of energy to make food for her family I learn from by seeing her cook an egg or make chicken I see her, and learn from her experience.

When we go to the beach my grandma always takes food so she wakes up early and starts cooking.

From the experience from my grandma I learn how to use spices and cuts of meats in a dish,

Also learn the amount of vegetables or spices that some dishes have my grandma been cooking for almost all her life she knows what taste good and what taste bad.

She teaches me how to cook some basic but delicious plates.

I think Learning from the experience of others is better because they been alive longer and know a lot about the topic like cooking, playing a sport, Driving, swimming or teaching they study or practice a lot that they became masters at it. They also been a live longer and knows how it works. Like my grandma she is good at cooking so I press attention to her cooking and see what new things I learn. An Example is when you are a teenager you want to buy the best of the best pair of shoes to show your friends that you got something that they done But if your parents say to not buy them and to save the money instead to buy something better and more special later in life like a car there is were we should press attention to what they say about spending money because they are older there brain is fully developed and they know what to save for because they are older and have been here longer and know how to use money.

For example when you wanna order something online you dont have to calll you can just order it online with out contaction anyone.

Technology can help you in manys ways. One way it can help you is by if you dont know the answers to a homework you can go on a computer or even a phone and look up answers and wedsites of where your answers can be. Another way is if you need to do technology work need to be done at home you can use a computer and send an email to your teacher without contacting her about it when your done. To me i see this as a positive effect on people because it can help you succed in school and complete things you need to do as well.

There are so many other ways technology can help you as well. when you wanna sign up for soccer you can regrister online. All you have to do is answers qustions put your information and once your done putting your information in you can pay for it and once you pay your coach will get an email that you singed up for his team. Technology for kids is positive when they are younger than 5. Letting them use phones and tablets would be good so they can learn how to say , words , letters, numberrs, and learn new things before they go to school and already know a couple things. So that to me is a posetive effect with technology

For sum people negative effects could also be negative for them also. When a parent dosent know how to use a phone it can be stressfull for them becuase they wouldnt know what to do unless someone is there to help him and do the things the parent needs to do on the one. Also another negative effect is when if you have all work saved in a computer and you get your computer wet and it wont turn on how are you gonna show your boss or teacher your so that would have a big negative effect on the worker. These are sum ways technology can have a negative effect on you.

To me technology has a poseitive effect in my life because I can be able to do more things and not have to worry about and contact people to help me do it. I also beleive for other people it can help aso for like, work, bank, food and more .

A35B4B7CBD24,"There are some of the school districts offer programs that allow high schools students to graduate in three years. There are also some good students who always have good grades in all the classes. To graduate one year earlier, students must take extra online classes or elective courses. Otherwise, they will not get enough credit to graduate in three years instead doing it in traditional four years. It is a good idea to graduate one year earlier and enter college or the work force one year earlier because if students finish high school one year earlier, they can admit into a good colleges and fixed their career little faster for lifetime, they can help their family with economic problems, they can also make their own purchases.

Initially, this idea to finish high school one year earlier is the best idea for them who want to fixed their lifetime career earlier. Some of the student who come from the other countries just by themselves also graduate in three years, may be because their entire family lives in back home.

Suppose, they do not live good life in their back home. That's when students want to give them a better life by bringing them here. To bring them here, the students have to be able to have enough money and to feed them enough after bringing. And students can do all these works earlier if they finish high school in three years instead being in a high school for traditional four years.

Secondly, this idea is good for the students who's entire family already lives here, and there are some economic problem in the family. Student have permission to graduate high school earlier and enter work force earlier to help their family with economic problems. They graduate in three years and get a better full time job and help their family with economic problems. So, that way their family will not get stuck anywhere for the economic problems.

Finally, this idea to graduate one year earlier is good for them who want to finish high school earlier, to go to college and also to have a part time job on the other hand. So, they can make their own purchases, like phone, paying phone bill, going out to eat with friends, going on a trip with friends, etc.

Students can also have a full time job who do not want to go to college.

There is nothing wrong with graduating from high school in three years by working hard.

Some students do it to make their dream become true faster, some students do it for their family problems, some students do it for their own problems. However or whenever students graduate but parents want them all to graduate and make their future bright. After all, graduating from school is most important thing in every students life.

First , I think its important to have a positive attitude in your everyday life because, of the stress that goes on. No one will understand how you feel other than you. If you stay in the mindset of "" i cant do this,"" ""this is too hard."" You will never see yourself prosper and grow. How can you have the biggest expectations in life when you are so dull and negative. To advance you need to be aware that everything is going to be okay, be reminded of that.

Secondly, your work place always has to stay positive. This is the place you go to work in , this is a place you try to distract yourself from the rest of the world. If you set your self to a person who feels as if they cant do anything then you will never reach that promotion youve been waiting for. If you set your self as the person who puts too much on themselves, you will never see growth. You can do the impossible it will just be up to you to change your circle.

Although, there are many people who live in doubt and build this wall of negativity in there life. You cannot be that person. Think about the little things in life , you have a roof over your head, your family is safe, you are safe. You never go a day without eating. Those are the little things that matter.

Lastly , in your "" time of need"" you should always be more optimistic. Whenever you are feeling down and feel like your world is falling apart be aware that your surroundings should never bring you negativity. There are so many other thing you could and should be thinking about, the little this matter in this life. Feelings are always temporary and you need to always make sure that the positive things impact you the most. Greater things are to come in everyone life.

In conclusion, being positive in many ways will always change your mindset . Positive attitudes are key to a better future and for the best success in your life. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5

Also is more hard to students understand by online. Also many students have hard time in class to understand that teacher explain in more hard they learn at home.

Some schools affter classes from home because they think is good option to students. Also students can stay more relaxing from home. Students have more time to do homework. Also they feel more comfortable at home. Also they feel safe at home with their family. Also student sleep more and stay with more energy to receive the class by online.

D9AAC11BC7AC,"The benefits of having a good attuide is always being postive when their's a bad day, and helping others if thier having a bad day too, and just always be excited to have a postive day. For example in my life when I don't have a good morning for example like missing the school bus or having a disaggrement with my parents. I try my best to leave a smile on my face and just have a great and postive day. Another example is when I see it in other people would be just diffrent because people are diffrent and they act diffrent in every way. What I mean by that is that they can be either mad, sad, or annoyed, or just super excited to have a great day. Why I say that they can act diffrent in the morning or afternnoon is because when your going to work your maybe tired and exhasted and stayed up till like 12 AM for an asssignment for your job. Same with school. On the other hand there could be people that are super excited to have such a great day for work or school. Those people are probably really excited because maybe they finished there assingment or homework quickly. Another one is the afternoon people that come back from school or work there. Sometimes there's people that can't wait to go home and eat and see their family and just go to sleep after that. On the other hand there's some people that are so tired that they can't even drive or even talk to the person that they've been picked up by. I've seen it all from so many people.

C868C220A380,"I disagree,and here on my reasons. If you just believe on your imagination then knowledge it wouldnt end up go for you. 1,people would think your crazy. 2,people would not even believe it would even work or would ever come true. Lastly,people would just think its plain old dumb if you believe in that.

I think people would think your crazy because if you keep living on your imagination then you'll get to stcuk in your own little games your in,and you'll sometimes forget what the real world thinks of you. The worst to come is that you'll get to scared to come to even go out into the real world. Knowledge is a powerful thing that everyone has,and its more powerful than your own imagination. If yo keeping thinking about your own little world your own little world you live in,then you would just forget on how the real world is a scary place.

Second of all,If you have a big imagination,people would not even believe that it would ever come true. Reson number 1,people would just believe in whatever you do. Think about it,their are so many ideas that just shut down,like how bills get made but they dont even get to the second step of becoming a law. Reason number 2,Everyone judges on what you think and what you believe. Some might agree,but most of all they just think your werid or crazy. So yes, it's scary to think on what people believe in what you imagine.

Finally,People would just think your plain on dumb. If your imagination gets to out od hand,people would just think your dumb or disagree with you. Yes,it's werid or even sad to have people judge or think your done with your own fantasy. People won't take you seriosly. And if they don't take you like you mean business,then they just won't talk to you at all. And your left with nothing but your own ideas. So,its risky to have a really big imagination because people would just think your plain on dumb or they might take your ideas and leave you with nothing.

In conculsion,I don't think it would be a great idea to have a big imagination. Knowledge is best because people won't judge you,they wont think your crazy,and they would believe you a 100%. I think its great having a big imagination,but dont get to attach to your imagination.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

C8620D9D22DC,"I think by having older students with younger students would be helpful. Because older students can help the younger students with homework,projects and classwork. Older students how to do the right things that can help the younger students.

To begin with, having older students can teach the younger students on what they need help with in school. This can be really helpful to younger students because with help someone that is older then you they can help you improve in school. Like for example my friend is one year older then me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by help the students with classwork. Having older students in a program can be useful because they can show the younger students how to act the right way in class,and show others to do what they need to do.

Additionally, younger students can look up to older students that they trust. Because they have helped them in school and having fun spending time with each other. Some younger students might think an older student can treat them as a sibling. Like for example I see one of my friends as a sibling because we have been friends since we where little and I trust them. So it's good to look up to some one that you trust and count on and be their for you when you need them.

Finally , I think having older students and younger students in the same program would be great. Because older students can show the younger students how to be right and do what your teacher tells you what to do. And parents want their kid to do good in school so they can have a good life to live. Having a mix of older and younger students can learn to do things together. By having older students it can effect the younger students to do good in school.

In conclusion, I think it's good to have a mix of older and younger students to be in the same program. This can help older and younger students to work together. And helping one in other is to help improve what they need help on. Like on homework,classwork,and projects to see what the need to improve.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0

Schools should allow students to pick there classes. If we were allowed to pick our electives then students would enjoy school more. We should be able to like our electives not dislike them.

What if student had to take art but they dont like it? They would not try the work and just fail the class. What about drama class,not everyone enjoys it so it shouldnt be required. Not every student wants to sing or play an instrument. Therefore they shouldnt be forced to take a music class.

Although it would be great for some student not all would like those classes. Therefore student should be allowed to pick there classes.

2003BF2E6DD0,"What is knowledge with little to no imagination? If you had a mind filled of knowledge but with barely any imagination then that would be the same as eating an Oreo with a dusting of cream in the middle. Just constant knowledge is boring, but adding imagination is like adding sprinkles on to a boring vanilla cake. Quantum physicist, Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Einstein is indeed correct because there are many ways imagination is more important than knowledge.

One reason why imagination is greater than knowledge is that of the ability to imagine the unthinkable. For example, how do you think Albert Einstein learned and explored the unknown of quantum physics? He used his mind to imagine the unthinkable. How you think Elon Musk came up with the idea to start a colony on Mars? He imagined in it all in his head. How do you think Steve Jobs invented the iPhone? He used imagination to gain that knowledge. Imagination is what fuels the mind to create knowledge. It's all in the head, that's where it all starts from.

Another reason why imagination is important is because of the benefits of using your imagination often. For example, using your imagination often will have you obtain a more creative and detailed mindset overall. You can also do many cool things using your imagination such as lucid dreaming, invent new ideas, or even train your mind to see the world in a different way. You should always use your imagination often to strengthen it. You should also try lucid dreaming to come up with brand new or more innovative idea while using your already known knowledge.

Finally, the last reason why imagination is more important than knowledge is that it can change you mentally and physically. How imagination can change you mentally as a person is by making you a better person or be a more fun person overall. How imagination can change you physically as a person is by motivating you to be a better by work outing and or going on jogs pretty often. As a result, using your imagination can change you in many ways as described above, unlike knowledge.

In conclusion, I agree with Einstein and his idea about how imagination is more important than knowledge. Using your imagination is benefiting, motivating, changing all in different ways. No matter who you are, you will be changed by the different ways imagination can affect you and on your already known knowledge. Imagination is alot more important than you think it is.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0
F131A67F5B95,"Being yourself is better than try to be someone else, being yourself brings you a true friends, not afraid to know who you are, and the most important is that you are honest. When someone is dishonest the person will not have true friends, maybe the person do not know who is. Being someone else is the greatest accomplishment in this world.

Being yourself brings a true friends.

In this world we love to make friends. Why? it because friends never let you down when we need them. Friends brings as happiness in our life, we can count with their time in conditional, friends are gift of God, whatever place we go, we always are going to find a friend. Friends are like family, they there for you no matter what, sometimes we fight with them but they will there for us because they know that you are being a true friend. Being our selves we always going to successful whatever we go.

Being yourself is know who we are. Know who we are, is being honest with our selves and not only with our selves same thing with the society that is around us. However;

some people might not likes us too much because of our action and the way how we talk hurt them. One action talk a lot of a person because demonstrate that that person know who he is. Know who we are helps with our self steam, also we make friend, the love of people and most important is that we loved who we are and not act like if we are someone else.

Finally being honest, is the best action that a person can have in life no lies, no disappointed on people, no issues. Being honest is how we can have true friends, not only true friends, we earn the respect of every single person that we work with or meet in life. People will trust in a person that is honest. not in a person that is dishonest. Whatever place we g, we most be honest with all kinds of people no matter what.

C1E9D98B3613,"I personally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson with his quote saying ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The reason i agree is because I believe that you have to set your goals higher, if mastered something already. Its always alright to fail trying to master your goal because nobody is perfect. You also need to try different goals to master so youre good at several things.

The first reason why i believe you should set your goal higher, if you have already mastered your goal is because if you keep doing the same thing youve done over and over and have already done great at it, you will not see any growth in you. For example if i was in a soccer team and played for a rec team. Which rec is when you sign up and get put on a team with no tryouts. If i played and score almost every game and always outplayed my opponents. I wouldnt grow as a soccer player because the opponents would be easy for me and wouldnt be a challenge so i would have to set my goal higher. For a higher goal i would have to move up to travel to see growth in me and have a challenge in the game.

I believe that people also disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because they are scared to set there goal higher when they have already mastered it. The reason i think this is because they are embarrassed to fail and not do something right. When i'm reaching a goal of mine like getting three goals in the net in a soccer game. I work hard to try to accomplish my goal so i can master it and score three goals every single game. Sometimes i fail and dont score three goals but i always tell my self its alright because when youre reaching a goal you will fail at least once or probably more then once. Which makes me work harder. Nobody is perfect and always a good thing to fail to learn about your mistakes.

The last reason why i agree is because you have to try to master different things in life. Sticking with the same thing you mastered will just not make you good at anything else. Its always great to have different things youre good at because you can do a lot of other things. If you dont like any of the goals you want to master and cant reach it. Its always great to have other ones along the other one youre trying to reach because i know a lot of people change their thoughts and want to do more then one goal at a time.

You have to set your goals higher if mastered something so you can see growth in yourself. When setting your goals higher you will fail at least once, you shouldnt worry because it makes you learn about your mistakes and so you wont do what you did to make you fail. Also you have to try different things to master to be good at several things in life. This is why i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote he wrote.      ",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
5F370D929BA7,"Would be good too that the younger students can be able to go to some schools of the older students, because they can learn how the High Schools goes and they can learn either what classes they are going to like.

They are going to be happy because they choose the classes that he have the chance to choose the classes for themselves.

Some students have a program that pairs older students with younger students. The older students are available to assist the younger students.

Is good that the students go to the schools but most will be the one's that are in the middle schools for what for nothing is good that the students that are in middle schools they are going to high school because they can talk with the teachers about the class and what is going to be about.

Can be good for some students because when get's the time to go to high school they can be sure what is going to be about the classes the he choose and all that stuff.

They are going to liked because they have the opportunity to choose their classes and for some reason is going to be more fun and the students wants to learn more about what is the teacher talking about because they choose them classes.

Sometimes the students don't know what classes they want to take when they go to high school because some students say that is hard to be in high school it is but you need to think that if you wanna do something hard you need to work hard and you can due because if you don't try you are not going to do something.

Sometimes the students don't like to help themselves but doing this can be helpful for them because they are going to say to themselves "" wait but is going to be cool choose my classes "". And they are going to want choose them classes and and they can learn what classes they can choose.

They are going to help others students and see what they due and what they are learning.

Helping other students is good they don't need to be at school but I don't like this class what can I do to changed but I can't changed it help them and they are going to be happy.

D2FB14A7C43B,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" However, it is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influences by others. It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do.

First reason is, People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influence by others. For example, my friend

Generic_Name has a son, who according to her he wants to be a lawyer. Generic_Name husband who's name is Generic_Name is a lawyer. Although their son Generic_Name is taking only math classes in collage, which it has nothing to do with laws. Generic_Name and Generic_Name want to influence Generic_Name to become a lawyer. But Generic_Name is being influence by his Algebra class teacher. Generic_Name has a very high score on math, and his Algebra teacher believe that Generic_Name can be a math teacher in a college. Generic_Name teacher knows how hard he works to do everything right and how his behavior it is showed.

Another reason is, It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do. For example, when my brother was nine years old he wanted to be a Pilot, but he was just really scared of heights. When my brother graduated from high school he wanted to go to Army. Somehow my mom find out that he really did not wanted to do that what he really wanted to do was being a Pilot. My mom is a Flight Attend and she told my brother that some people will say you are too weak to do this and that, but they actually does not know what you are capable to do. With those words my mom influence my brother, and now he is a Pilot and he works for the Air Force. My mom gave him an example that no one believed on her the only person who believed on her was her mom. As my mom says, "" Don't let other people think you are not able to do things, which they we're not able to do.""

Some people may think that there are better ways to influence others. However, it can be true, but people get more influence by examples. There are not many ways for example, if someone who is very important who wants to influence someone else who is not that important to be come important as they are. Does not mean this person is going to have the same luck to become really important. Do not let other people influence you by other ways, let them give you an example of how you are going to success.

In conclusion, It is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. To teach them what it is good and what it is wrong to do. Given your own examples and teach them how to behave. Dot let people think that example is not the main thing to influence others.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5
DFCF2A3BE972,"The program that the school provides for attending classes online could have a positive outcome or it could have a negative outcome. Different school have different ways of doing things. Some school don't provide this type of programs, in others do. Different type of people have different type of view of attending classes online. People would agree that is a good idea but other would say its bad idea. Having online class you don't have to wait for other people to finish. You could do what pace you want and to do your classes. It could have a negative part to attending online school. Your WIFI could go slow or not work at all. Having a hard time to achieve the work. Not having a different environment with people with the same age. Not doing the work that they assigned you.

When a student have class online they could find it defalcate to achieve the work that they been assigned to. You would not be able to ask question about the problem. Would have to figure it out by your self. Some online website would not help you to achieve what you are looking for. It could give a bad answer and then you got the whole assignment wrong. In videos you could find ways to achieve it but sometimes there is not a lot of videos on things that you are looking for. If you where in a class room you could ask a teacher to show you how to solve it and you would probably would understand it more. In online school sometimes there is no teacher available at the time when you need them. Sometimes student don't have the time and sometimes they don't turn in there work on time. Would just put it to the side and say"" they would probably do it later"" and never do it. It could be found defalcate to achieve the work on time.

When you so round your self with people that are the same age. You could have study patterns and you could ask them for help. Doing online school its just you and the computer and the class you are taking. Probably have friends but they mite not be taking the same class as you,would not be a able to work together or study. Doing online school would maybe not have time to socialize with new people. You may work or do other things but most of the times they could be older or you just don't talk to people a lot. Having different environment could help you to learn more and plus you would not be by your self. Have other people with you in the same room. Not just you home by yourself with a computer. Having classes online you would not be sou round with people your age.

Doing online class sometimes could give out a lot of work to do in one day. In the same day you have to turn it in. It could be challenge when you dont know what they are talking about or you just don't understand it. Doing your work is one important thing to do, to understand the class and what its teaching. Not just going online to find something that kind of looks like the work and you just copy it down. Sometimes student could get lazy and not do there work. Would probably leave it for the last minute to turn it in. The laziness of student could end up with no good grades or passing the class, would take the class all over. You could get distracted really fast with other things that is going on in your life. Not doing the work, it would not take you no where and would not finish the class on time before the due date.

The school would give different ways for student to attend class. It could be online class or going to a classroom in a school. It would be helpful for student to attend more class and probably have more free time. Sometimes student could take advantage on this program to just stay home and do nothing. Life could be hard sometimes and you could go through things that you don't expect to happen. It could be defalcate when you don't know the subject and there is no teacher around to help you. Students always choose whats right for them. Attending classes online could be defalcate to achieve. Would not be sou rand by people their age and probably not do there work.

89506A98AC2B,"People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life.

I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the corage to do surtend things.

You would belive in yourself and most possiblie make your goals come true.

It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt.

People wont be able to brake you down that easily.

So in my personal opinion, having a possitive attitude actually is the key to a success in life.

When i said it gives you the corage to do surtend things i mean it.

Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or your thinking ""oh theres no way im going to make it"".

Thats the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action.

Sometimes your words reflect your actions.

This is why i think if you have a possitive attitude you will sucess in life.

Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of ""faith"".

Lets talk about why i mention ""faith"".

Having faith makes you believe in yourself'

When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action.

But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible.

This is why i compare these two words, that are very similar to each other.

So if you have ""Faith"" you must have a possitive attitude.

Having a positive attitude can help you out emotionaly too.

If your possitive at all times no matter what people say about you it wont hurt you as bad.

The reason i belive it wont hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and wont let other negative attitude ruin yours.

For example, if i say to myself ""Man i alredy know i aint going to pass this test , i aint even going to try"".

Oviosly im going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try.

So if you want to sucess in life like i do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
1D944BF5BE87,"Yes I think it is a good idea for students to plan their career early because students can be prepared for the real world, it can help with jobs, and it could help them in college. When students graduate they will face challenges . They have to find a job to support their needs. Students will also need to find what they want to do in life to make them be successful. A planned career really gives a head start to those who want to achieve more and be prepared.

The real world is tough if you dont have a plan because it can be too late to accomplish goals. Planning at a young age gives students advantages for their work. This also helps with a students resume if they want to attend college.

Jobs want students who are successful and take work seriously. When a student graduates they want to make it in life and not struggle.

Another reason students should plan early is for jobs. A job gets people money and they can use this for more school or for other needs. A planned job at a young age is a very good head start for many reasons. Students can save up for college or by a vehicle. An early job gives them a lot of experience and helps benefit when they look for more places to work outside of school.

More reasons students should plan their careers early is for college. College helps keep them in school giving more education. More education and knowledge also helps students get better jobs. Getting better jobs helps students make more money for their future. The money helps support their needs for example like owning a house.

Some people today dont want to go to college which does not mean they wont be successful. Sometimes students prefer to find better jobs to make a living without anymore education. When students dont plan ahead that also does not mean they are always too late for anything. Students would sometimes need more time to figure want they want to do in life. As long someone works hard they can accomplish all their goals and commit to a career at a young age.",4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0
F45967CEFA55,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated a quote that said, ""success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss."" There are 3 reasons why I agree with this statement. The first reason is, failing will want to make you push for a success, the second reason being that you'll have more of enthusiasm when you're find more ways to succesed, and the third reason is achiving for higher goals.

I agree strongly with this prompt and Winston Chruchill's quote, yet some people think it's something at may not be true and think less of them self. In the first paragraph I will explain my first reasoning with a strong example of it.

First, reasoning to this prompt would be, falling will want to make you push for success. Even though not many people think that is the way that many of our past inventors had learned. Albert Enstine was one of the smartest people out there, yet he had come face to face with failure many times in his life. The only way he learned was to try many other different ways to solve his problems. He used failure as an insperation to to keep trying like our first inventor of the light blub. Even though many people found it frusterated and diffivult when they've failed, which pushes on to my second reasoning.

Next, the reason would be that many people think different about them selfs when they fail in something. Thomas Edison thought different, even though he had failed 100 times, he had not gave up. When he finally successed, he said a quote that is in my mind till today in this presnet day. That quote was ""I didn't fail 100 times, I found 100 ways that it didn't work."" Even though, Thomas Edison had failed he maintaned him self with a lot of enthusiasm, Failure is never an option, but finding a solution to it is a success.

Finally, the last and final reason is achiving for high goals that you want to reach. It don't matter what others may think of it or if you'll be able to achive or not. Show them that they are wrong even if you come to a failure don't stop, find a solution and fix it to make it better than before. You'll reach higher goals with higher potential then what you'll ever imagine. Then later on you will be able to do anything you put your mind to and demonstrate your knowlage to the world.

In conclusion, doubting yourself is not how you achive your success. Finding a way to solve it is achive your success. Get the insperation from the people who had once been in your spot and they done to successed to there goal. Even if failure is a role in life to find success it's the only way youll reach it. Failure is only a motivation to get you to successed.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
196096A1C048,"I would like to become a Cardiologist in my future, so that I can save people's lives by charging them less money and nobody has to suffer like my uncle, it is one of the high-paying jobs and there are less heart surgeons in the world. My uncle was detected with a hole in his heart since he was born. But my family couldn't afford the money for the surgery, so they left him like that itself. He started feeling more pain when he studying his final years of high school. When he went through the surgery, he had exams going on. Despite the pain, he studied for his exam and passed in flying colors. Many people cannot afford the surgeries for not only heart but for many organs in their body. So, I wanted to change that and help all the people in the world, so that they can live happily at least once in their lifetime.

It is one of the high-paying jobs in the world. My family was not able to treat my uncle because of not having enough money at that time, so I wanted to earn money and save lives at the same time as much as I could. In this way, every body in my family will not be able to endure all the pain they had even before I was born. I will do anything to keep my family happy.

In this world, we have more doctors in other fields but not much in the cardio field. I wanted to change that because half of the world's population has hidden heart defection, they don't know still, like my uncle. This is because of less cardiologists in the world. When people go to the heart surgeons, the doctors ask more money then the usual charge as there are only a few doctors in that field. People cannot afford the money they ask and just leave their defected hearts, they continue doing their day-to-day works. If this continues, then people will die without even enjoying their whole life in this world. I wil become a heart surgeon and charge my patients the money they can afford. With this I will also be happy and the people who come to me will also be happy as they get cured.

In conclusion, becoming a cardiologist is one of big dreams I want to achieve in my life. I will save people's lives only by costing them with affordable money. I won't let my fellow people go through what my uncle did, so I would do anything to save their lives. People are dying across the world because there are only a few doctors in that field and they also charge them high, so I will change these people's lives by doing the opposite of what the other doctors did. I want to change this world into a better place to live because everything here is money, so i hope i can change it.

To begin with my talent, my talent is roaring like a lion, is like a deep voice and just pushing air in my throat. My other talent is hoola-hooping with my arms, just making circles with my arms for the movement of the hoola-hoop. My final talent is drawing, i enjoy drawing because i can draw what i'm feeling but i need to be more detailed.

Next my skill, my skill is swimming fast, I only use my arms and legs for more movement and i would need a lot of energy for it. My other skill is running fast, I use my legs and ball up my fist for more movement. My final skill is holding my breathe long, it's risky but I would beat my friend's scores.

Finally both of my skill and talent, my favorite talent is roaring because I would scare my friends and it's funny. My favorite skill is swimming fast because I can possibly beat anyone's scores. My least favorite talent is hoola-hooping with my arms because it's not really impressive anymore.

that is how more we ca have concentration during the assigments in class.

I think these thow ways of work , can get a good results. Because working with a group or with ourselves , oneself have the responsability to concentrain and do our work. It is only put us effort to aprove classe.

When we working with a group during in class, this are help for us in class to convert more fun. We can share our ideas to do more faster the assignments. Also help to ourselves when one of the group don't usterstand about the topic. Even if the assignment are complete ,

the rest of the time the members maybe can talk to each other.

But this happen also when the students have a good communication and they are friendly. However sometimes can be difficult even the sudents don't try to study with the group or only due the part of oneself.

Sometimes is better working with agroup , because when working by oneself taht can be a little frustrate.

Students can have support with a group , but when a student working alone is difficult research information without a opion of another person. Working with a group students can be more fiendly with anothers students of differents countries and they can be more caring.

Students can show their abilities and be more prepare when they get a job. Also students learn more of the members . In totality this is a argument to the students that they can't work alone , but they have the opcion to work with a group to prepare.

In conclusion , I agree that is more better to work with a group in class than alone . It is a benefits to discover new people, hear more ideas,

and be fliendly. I think is more helpful to students do the assigments in class. Work alone can be difficult , but sometimes these help oneself to be indepent . It is more great have a goup with members that gonna help. It is only concentration in a group or not , beacsuse oneself need to be more improve everyday and pass classes.

A79D997C4B42,"Working with a group has more benefits then working alone because with a group you can all help each other and learn new things, also so people can be more social and you can get the work done faster and aso there can be some pressure . When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around other's. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new.

Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the one's to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase that's what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do.

Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learn's something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.

Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group.

Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy. Working in a group has more benefits then working alone because working alone you have to do everything on your own and with a group they can all help.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do.

If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job!

424005E31A04,"Do people ever told that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life ?

Well,that true for you to be success in life you got to have a positive attitude .

when you talking around attitude is how we act ,talk ,and how we deal with thing that are happening. Say that person you are working with and the person next to you do or says something that is not so great, and let say that you were really mad and very upset about ,and you choose not to fight or talk back to him/her. In my preview I would say you act base on what happen and you had a positive attitude about what just happen. Attitude can be a big problem for some people and Sometimes you just need to have a positive attitude .When your thoughts think that positive attitude is the key to success will you not wrong ,I know that when you choose to have a positive attitude it depend on what going on and how you want to handle the matter .For example you are on your way to the school and you meet one of the teacher let say Mrs. Jade,will Mrs. Jade asks if you are okay and she ask you if you are gonna come to school because you have many days of absent at school , and say that you have your own personal problems and you just don't want to tell her about it .So you decide not answer her because you are not in a good mood and you might talk to her rudely and she would think that you have an attitude or bad behavior and thought if I have problem with her or be rude to her it would be the worse so I will not say anything .That would it and you would just kindly walk way. Attitude can be anything in life attitude is not just the way you treat other it can be how you manage things and how you think and act with a positive attitude. When you think back it can also be something that create your connection with those who are in your surroundings. For example when you meet a someone for the first time and you were nice to them everything about you was positive and you were did not hind anything from her and that person might draw a liking into you .And you might end up being their friends or bests. The thing of having positive attitude is that many people might not act the same way as you ,so you have to be the one being positive .People say a beautiful heart comes from in and out of that person .It the same thing with having a great positive attitude when think about it people do and say what they want to said and no one is stopping them .So with positive attitude is the same way people do it because they want to and even if you say that you want to stop them I don't think that you would do it. Because it their choice to do what they want to do .Say when you want to eat can anyone stop you and if not then why would they stop you from what your doing .These things we do it so that our life can be great base on what we see we act,make choice ,and choose the right or wrong that why everything we do in this world we do it with positive attitude .And think about when you are making choices do you have to be a greater thinker or smart no all you have to do is have a great idea and a positive attitude to it when you say it because sometimes thing are easy said then done .when a person is saying something or doing something they have a way of doing and saying that this day .when people are talking they use attitude to do or say something and you have to away think that your the only one doing but sometimes it not just you it might be the other way around and you might say oh ,so that how it done .What l'm saying is that positive attitude can be a good thing to those who know what it means to them and why they are having it. Have you ever meet a person they're so nice to you when no body is around ,but when people are around they act so mean to you ,and some people are really nice to you ,because they mean it and they want to be your friend and when you at some of these thing does have something to do with positive attitude and most of them just put on an act and when your the one they doing this to sometimes you don't if having positive attitude or not everybody knows what we do in the future but I know one thing for sure .That if you have a positive attitude ,The your future clear for sure because when you about the future the only thing that comes to mind is how are success and all you need is positive attitude and focus on what you can do because believing is living .And if you believe you have to have that positive attitude going ,because once you start a journey one can never stop until it's end ,Positive attitude can be the thing that can help you do what other can't do ,if you ask why it because you have a life and that most of the people in the the world need positive attitude so that they can have a peaceful life and one most never stop until you find what your looking for. Having a good attitude can not only be the key to success in life but it can help you be a wonderful person. Being kind to someone,helping people,and making people about you happy and it can also make you happy. why ,because you have a positive attitude and when you success in life you will be happy. The thing is when talking about positive attitude can be the key to success in life, is like you are talking about happiness is a wonderful thing that happen in a world and make people happy. So when saying key to success in life your talking about how you act ,respect,what you do?, and how will you success in it when your looking for positive attitude so that you can success. Their are not a lot people who have a positive attitude in this world,but their are people who are bringing positive attitude in this world. When you think about success in life do you think it would be great if everyone had the chance to be success in life ,but to be fair life is suppose to be hard that way we can learn from our mistakes.

Yes : I agree with Winston Churchill. I know some people say that too, to be success at first; you going failure to failure, in once you try not to failure guest what, you fail again. This can be happen , but Winston was right , to success you can fail all the time. When somebody want to be success in he/she fail, that doesn't mean they cannot "" try"" again. But the thing is, they need to get up in keep trying on till then.

If success brought people failure to failure, then what would that be in life, when you fail on try to be success, it not a bad thing cause sometime in life either you: win or you loos, but at least you can try one more time. Failure might be discourages you, but you can Always keeping going to accomplish your gold, or maybe you might "" successful"" after all.

1)Success is a good thing for those who fail in fail in the results, they successful. Winston idea was right, so my position is that success consists of going from failure to failure without loosing enthusiasm are lesson you. With enthusiasm your success going greats and fast. Thats it true enthusiasm try to find your success can make a big differences. An in endurance can bring you to successful too, in time you'd need it.

2)If you pursuit or enthusiasm your can success anything that you thing that hard can be easier's for you, cause you put your ; Enthusiasm, and convicted your issue. Failure without trying "" does not"" gave nothing excepted discourage, in that will be stupid of you if you failure in you give up in the same time.

Anabel for you to be success you need enthusiasm, it gonna give courage, and not to focusing on you failure, then you'll never success or accomplish your gold. For example : Generic_Name his a psychology teacher in Generic_School,Generic_Name never thought he will be a teacher cause his gold was to teach psychology, unfortunately he cant past his test so that he can graduated, but he thought about it , he put all his enthusiasm on it Generic_Name past the test in now his a successful guy. There are tree reason that "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

ONE, if you a failure in you didn't put your enthusiasm on you ""success"" you'll never be successful.

TWO, take example about people who never thought they will success, such ass Generic_Name, Generic_Name,and Generic_Name Generic_Name.

TREE, always get up when fail, always focuses on you success, and take that serious when you a failure. As a Mather of fact , look at all the Hollywood stars' , some of them didn't born with success some of them were poor, having no skills ,and some of them didn't have no education. They work hard in hard to be success cause that was their gold to be "" success"" in they accomplish it even if they fail sometime.

Winston Churchill was right about that, i'm 100% agree with his statement. If you a failure in then you loss your enthusiasm you will never be "" success"" . That's a true statement for success, in

I really Agree with Churchill's statement about the important role failure plays in the pursuit of success.

I'll say the policy #1 because student its a good rule that student can only use there cell phone during the lunch and other free time so that the student can do something that make them fun during lunch time. its also good because student uses there phone to call there parent to pick them up or they forgot something on there house he or she can just call there parent to bring it to school.

Bring cell phone in school is important because cell phone is not just for texting its also for emergency for your parent if you need something or you have to go somewhere after school. you can also call and tell them that don't pick me up because I'm going to my friend house and i call you when you have to pick me up.

School is already not fun for many of the students, and by staying more in school students may have a bad mood or adituted, and it may lead to bad behavior and not make them get good grades! I disagree because it can be very tiring to stay school more longer, it can change your mood of being in school, and you may want to got out with friends or family.

The First reason, Is because if we stay more longer in school you are gonna get more tired. If you get tired in school you are not gonna have more energy to go outside and entertain yourself. And you would just go home and sleep all day long. However, if we don't extend the school hours, we won't be as tired, and we would have energy to go outside.

The Second reason, Is that if we stay longer in school it can change the way you are. Staying in school longer can change your mood because you won't be as happy. Because you would have to stay in school longer. Also you might have teachers you don't really like and you would have to see them longer. However, it doesn't have to be that way, if we don't extend the school hours.

The Final reason, Is that you woudn't have time to spend with your friends or family. Because most of that time you would be in school. ANd spending time with friends/family is the most important thing in life and school shouldn't take all the space froem your life.

3821238FE334,"""I don't need to go to school for to learn new things, I can learn the same things in my home"" Some students believe that is not necessary go to school to learn because they can attend classes from home. Some schools offers distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. This is a good option for students whose can not come to school for their jobs or their kids but, they want to study and to get a High School Diploma. The majority of people assure that students need come to school for to learn but, they are wrong because students can learn the same things at home. Many students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

First, Some students can not come to school everyday because they have a full-time job and their parents do not support them. For example, Many students do not have the same opportunities than others students so, they have to become independent. As a result, they have to leave from their homes and to find a job so, they sacrifice to study because they don't have time to come to school. With this option, they can go to work then, they can take their classes at home after work without to feel pressure by their responsibilities.

Second, This option can avoid the absents for students don't like come to school. For example, Some students don't like come to school and they prefer stay at home because they are attacking by schools' bullies. These students feel more confident in their home than in the school and, they believe that this option is the best way for to solve their school's problems. They also prefer this option because they are shy and they don't like to speak or to do presentations in front of the class by the students make fun of them.

Another reason for this option can would help many students is the students have kids and they can not come to school by their kids because they don't like that another person take care their kids and they prefer stay at home with their kids than come to school. Attending classes from home is an excellent strategy for students whose can not come to school by their kids because they will can take the classes and to get a High School Diploma without to leave their kids with someone else.

As you can see, Many students would benefit form being able to attend classes from home because it's a big opportunity to finish their High School even if they can not come to school frequently by their jobs or kids. It also helps students don't feel confident in the school for schools' bulliers or their feelings.         ",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5

A people can hurt someone else feeling based on their opinion, because they do not think what adequate words they going to say. And when they want to fix the problem may be too late. The first impressions are almost impossible to change, because people can hurt someone else feelings and cause people change.

First impressions can hurt people's feelings in fact, I did to my sister yesterday. My sister and I were talking about her wedding yesterday, her wedding is next year in April, and we are preparing for her best day ever. We have to look for her dress and all the things that she is going to use for that day. She is like my second mother, and I want to make sure she looks beautiful on that day. While we were talking and looking for dresses in the internet, she saw a wedding dress, and my first impression was like, no that dress is ugly, and I told her she was going to look like a real skull in dress, because she is skinny. But I never thought I was going to hurt her feelings in my first impression, the dress was ugly, even though she liked but I wanted for her the pretties dress for her wedding. I felt badly for her, because I did not think my words before I said to her. I told her sorry, but she was little upset about me for the words I said to her, as I always say, what people say is what they receive. Lately my sister did not talk to me, I was sad and I talk to her, I apologized for the words I said. She told me it was okay, that I did not meant to said it. My sister and I, we are happy now. In the following manner, my friend Generic_Name invited me on her birthday and Her friend told me that I was looking ugly, and that I was a ugly and slow girl, in front of her other friends, her impressions about me hurt my feelings. She retract based on what she said, but it was too late, I left from Generic_Name party I went home, and I was little sad, the girl went to my home she wanted to talk to me, she apologized and I told her she hurt my feeling but I was fine, and gave her some advises and she left with this, first impressions are almost impossible to change because hurt someone else feelings.

Additionally, first impressions can cause people change, as an example of my best friend I gave her an opinion about her boyfriend. I told her that he does not love her, because I saw him kissing with a girl in the school. She told me I was crazy, I was just jealous because she had the most handsome boyfriend in the whole world. Matter of fact he was cute, but he wanted just play with the girls. My best friend change with me a lot, she did not want to talk to me no more. About the things that I told her. Lately I realized that he had a twin brother I made a mistake, that my first impressions to him was a fatal mistake. After all, I wanted to apologize with my best friend, but she was mad with me. It was impossible to talk with her. I realize that my first impressions about the idea of his boyfriend had change my friendship with her. Today I just talk rarely with her, it was almost impossible to change my idea, but I did, but my friendship is changed. First impressions cause people change.

Some people may say, the first impressions is possible to change immediately, because is not a big deal. They may say that the other people, does not care about their first impressions from them. But this is not case, people always get hurt when they receive a bad impressions to them, they make them to change even with themselves. First impressions are almost impossible to change, even if the problem is big.

Thus, the first impressions is almost impossible to change, because what people say is not easy to retract. Is not easy to correct the mistakes, is not easy to correct the words that people do not meant say them. If people say their impressions without thinking them, and then apologized that is fine, but sometime is almost impossible to correct the first impressions, because people hurt someone else feeling. Also, there are sensitive people and they may not forgive people. People may change based on someone else idea, feeling, and opinion. The impressions are almost impossible to change.                          ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
7A68E1FB7863,"Imagine an aboard student come from different country that is far away from United State, so she need a long summer break to return to her country for visit her family. Summer break is what educators and students are looking forward for. Whereas many people argue that the break should be year-round schools, and it should be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. The summer break should be longer and less short break because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home.

While many people believe that the summer break should be shorten, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall because the educators feels that if the break too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, this is a week argument. For instance, a break in the middle of the school year easy to get students forget what they have learn. Further more, students will not want to go back to school after few days off. Students need break but a short break is unnecessary.

To begin with, students are waiting for a long summer break where they can spend all their time at the place that they wish to be at. For example, an exchange student from Vietnam came to United State with her parents for emergrates, but her siblings still live in Vietnam because they were married before sign up. Summer break is the only time that allows the student to go back to her country for visiting. Furthermore, some students are working full time in summer to have a provision for their consumption in the future such as buying a car, college,etc. The part time work that students make during school year does help but not much for preparing or satisfy the claim inside teenager.

In addition, people want to have a relax time on a long vacation, none of the students want to be thinking that they still have work waiting for them at home and the deadline is coming. For instance, teachers love give homework during the break for no reason. Going out with friends but still have to bring paper and pencil to do homework is very humor. Furthermore, some teacher put onerous on students, which they giving out homework and big project for a test grade just because they don't want the student to forget the information that they have learn. Students didn't expect teachers to finish grading their work during the break, but teachers expect them to finish the big project, it is unfair for students.

As a final point, the summer break should be longer because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. For long summer break teacher don't give homework, and students feel free to plan out their vacation for entire summer. The long break is much better than a short and unnecessary break.

People can check out books,shop,and play games without speaking to another persons .Has the limitation of human contact due to the technology has positive or negative effects on people's lives? I think this is negative, because the rate of oversize people will grow. People shouldn't spend most of there time on devices or inside. They should go out in the real world and see how things are. How nice people are to them .

First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you won't meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun. They also meet people online and let what the people online think of them. that effects a lot of peoples lives.

Then, teens would be on video games all day rather than go out and do something active. That will increase oversize teens and adults in America. Technology can take over someones life they can be hooked to it. That its self harms the brain all types of ways.

Although, people are getting there things done without having to go and talk to other people. They can lose a lot of vitamin D. That can cause to death and in that way we would have a lot of deaths. and our population will decrease because of technology.

In Conclusion, what the people are doing isn't right technology shouldn't keep us away from each other. we as people should stand up for each other. we should get out more and have a community picnic and be with each other. Not away in our houses getting what u want from online and letting people you haven't meet and hadn't meet you determine who or what u are let your friends say what they thing and u tell yourself who and what you are.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

If you start talking to someone for the first time and you think their personality is really bad try to know the person more. In my experience, when I see someone for the first time like at work or school right away I think they're mean from their face expressions and attitude. Sometimes they think the same way too, so they are mean back.

You should spend time together and go to places where both of you guys like to go. Their attitude might of changed because maybe they needed someone to talk to and go out more. There's people that their personality are just different and you have to accept it.

Lastly, People go through a lot in life and their personality starts to change. Also, you have to ask them how they feel because sometimes they feel depressed or angry about something and need someone to talk to. It's better to be there for them or help each other out.

In conclusion, people say ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" because you never know why they behave like that. If you don't know them, still ask if they're okay. It is possible to change their personality and make them a better person.        ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.5

Imagination has helped me realize that i could become who ever I wanted to be. It even helps me through any problem. It help me realize that can prove people wrong by just imagining the best things in life are coming my way. No matter how much i'm going through, i'm always going to be happy and grateful for what I have and gone through. Without the bad days you will never know how to enjoy the good ones.

Remember everything happens for a reason!

Imagination helps me have hope no matter what I have gone through . I had to imagine a lot when my brother went to jail. I would always have to believe thats it going to be fine. I would always imagine that my brother was home and that I could see him again. No matter how hard it was for me. Every time we would go visit him and it was time to leave I had to imagine that he was coming home with me. Even every time we would go to court I would have to imagine that they would let him leave. Sometime knowing thats their two much on my head, imagining help me feel free and peaceful with no problem.

It was hard dealing with my brother and school on top of that. Imagination really change how I look at life. It makes me bring out my creativeness out. It made me realize what I have been missing out on. Imagination help me forget everything thats going on in life no matter how big or small the problem is. Also it help me feel myself and not pretending to be someone that i'm not. Sometimes going through things help you understand why it happened to you. But at the movement it might seem horrible. I just know that there is a purpose for me and that end!

Knowledge might be a great thing but imagination helped me achieve things that I never thought before. Imagination help me feel good about my self. It help block all the negative things. Imagining helps me know that I can do what ever I want , I just have to put my mind and heart to it. Also it helps me feel unique from everyone else. It helped me gain self respect and convinces. Imagination is a great thing for every thing. It might seem weird but it helps in many different ways.

Especially if they are important persons like friends,family,or girlfriend in those cases People get afraid to loose them or make them unhappy.

""JOHN LUBBOCK"" once wrote a amazing quote that speaks the true. ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make of it. that quote along changed my mindset, many people would disagree with John and his way of thinking but i personal agree with what he wrote,theres a lot of true behind his words, People shouldn't focus about others opinions or let bad experiences or events shape its character. I personal believe characters arent beyond our control after all we are the ones that control our way of thinking and reacting to them. My self has seen my tree closes friends Generic_Name,Generic_Name and Generic_Name ended up really bad after they decide to let bad events,experiences, and opinions shape the way of their characters.

Generic_Name one of my closest friend decided to let one big events shape his character and at the end everything went wrong for my dear friend. When he was a little kid he contently got hit by his parents in he grew up mad and he started using violence at school he would get in trouble all the time and his parents would get super mad and would use violence against him too they say it was to ""teach him a lesson"" everything went like that for him until many years passed and he got married and he contently used violence every time she did something wrong, he was mad about what its parents did to him so he would always hit his wife until one day he end up killing her and himself.

Generic_Name my other close friend let experiences shape his character in a bad way.

when he was a young man falling a love with pretty girls many of those girls just wanted to play with his feelings. Those girls never took him seriously until one day he got tired of the way girls would treat him and he loose feeling and he become just like those girls he didn't like at first. My friend Generic_Name started playing with girls feeling and he end up by him self and never finding true love, one he got true love but bad experiences make him loose feelings for all females and he played the one true love he had.

Generic_Name friend of mine let opinions got the best of him, he was contently trying to be someone he wasn't just so people he love would love him back but at the end he was just hurting him self because he wasn't happy like that he was just lying to himself and acting for other people.

EDFFA0E4D88C,"Should school weeks consist on four days with days of 10 hours of school ? on my opinion there is no point on doing that, people that work is going to miss hours at work because of this, students are going to use that extra day to not study and be home doing nothing, and people instead of using electronics at school are going to use them more at home.

Some students work after school, they need time to go home and get ready for work and with school days being longer it would be pointless to work, you will be making 3 or 4 hours a day, some students,specially on senior year, need to pay bills or make money for the future to pay college. on my opinion the best thing to do is to keep the regular five days at school, and to keep working at least six hours a day.

Teachers and staff members are thinking that students are going home and they will do their homework or study, but what they dont think is that some people need help with school work, or they feel more comfortable studying at school, now with that less day they will be more students failing projects and exams, for example if a students used to study at the library after school he is not going to be able because it is going to be late by the time he gets out of school, they should keep the normal schedule for all the students that are getting benefits from it

People wants to save energy and money by taking away a day of school, but they dont think that students will be going home to use their cellphones, watch TV, play video games, and a lot of more things that consume energy, if they stay at school they are not going to be able to use their cellphones or any other electronic device, they will just use it during breaks and lunch, so that is less time than being home a whole extra day.

For all this reasons a think that it would be better for students to keep with the regular schedule and keep coming to school everyday, for the regular hours, in that case they will not miss any hours at work, they will have more time to study and to do homework at school, and they will not use their electronic devices as much as they would at home, even though the idea of saving money and electricity its such a good idea some students dont understand that and they will not do it at home.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Having a good attitude can helps people to get a job. For example, if there is two guys on a job interview and one of them show a positive attitude while are asking him questions but, the other person is answer all the question with a bad attitude, the person with a positive attitude will get the job because, a good attitude show who you really are.

Showing a positive attitude can really show where you came from and how your parents educate you. Other wise, if a person show a bad attitude and he is insulting all the people and his way that demonstrate that his parents didn't gave him a nice education. Because, the attitude came from how your family had teach you to respect the people.

A nicely attitude can even help in the education. In other way attitude is the most important key in education because, nobody will teach someone with a bad education. It is important to demostrate a positive attitude when a teacher is explaining something because, that way you desmostrete the techer how much effort you are putting in the education and that you really want to success in your life.

22F16C83DE10,"Students Summer Break Ideas

Most of students like to enjoy their summer vacation,but some educators feel like summer vacation is too long. Students and Adults decided to come up with different set of ideas to make summer break not long.. Some of the students are fine with having 2 or 3 months of summer break,and some people argue that there should be a year-round schools. A year- round school is were there would be 3- 4 week break in summer, a longer winter break,and a week off in spring and fall. These were the overall ideas that both students an Adults choose.

My personal opinion is that i would go with the year- round school because it would only take a year that students would go to school and have a shorter summer and a longer winter break. The reason why i choose this was because i prefer having a longer winter break. why? you may ask , having a longer winter break wil make students not lose a lot of school because in most part of the United States snows a lot. About 75% of parents have called in school saying that their children is sick and will not be able to go. These type of excuses can cause students lower their education and making up the work of days they haved missed. Instead of the founder of school saying their would be an ""2 hour delay"" or ""schools are close"" . Students can just stay home while having their winter break and not worrying about if they are going to school or not.

Having a shorter summer break can help bring students come back to school with a positive energy and a fresh start. Since summer break won't be long studens won't forget what they haved learned. Students are likely to fail if they would have have a really long break this is the reason why students forget what teachers haved taught them. Teenagers are likely to be more tired during the winter instead of summer this is why students are mostly tardy or absent. Even though i prefer having a shorter summer break, i still rely of the students that choose to have a longer break because it is fun to be able to go out when the weather is warm but at the same time i feel like is better having a longer break in the winter because is safer staying home when it gets really cold and when it snows.

Schools that are in the middle recontructing have to allow students take their classes out in the trailers. Even though public schools don't close when it snows a little they still have to reconsider. Some schools are constucting and students have to walk to one trailer to another to get to their class this why i like the idea of having a week off during fall and also when it's spring break ,It gets a bit cold and in some areas it already starts to snow. Having fall and spring break can bring students get their week off and take some time off before they have their SOL. It can also help refersh their brain and can start studying to be able to pass their upcoming tests.

My final conclusion is that the year-round schools sound like a good idea. It can really help students manage a lot with their education and also responsibilities. It can also help teachers not being stressed because they can also take their days off. School won't be that stressing if it were to take this idea. All of these were my own personal opinions.            ",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

In my opinion

I disagree with Emerson becasue even if you are a master in an specific area you never stop growing, everyday you learn more about your mistakes and about life and how to live a good one, also you learn something new that helps you in all types of areas that you have in your life.

However in this world there will be someone that will disagree with your opinion, because they have different type of mentality,or they think in a different way.

If you have a goal you never need to stop growing on it, becasue is something that you really want for your future and you want to do that for the rest of your life. That is why you need to choose carefully what do you want, because maybe in the future you can regret and that is a bad thing that you can erase,becasue you feel frustrate because you spend a lot of time on something that you didn't like.

Being an expert in an area is something really important, the positive things for being a master is that:

You domain your area and nobody needs to command you.

You can do the things easily and quickly.

You are an expert in what are you doing, so you are exited.

Is more easier to get good things, something that benefits you.

You can get great jobs with a good payment.

You can be also your own boss or manager.

There is also negative things for being a master:

There are many people that they are an expert in any area

You need to compet with your rival

You need to try to be the best

If you have a business and you are making some mistakes you need to fix it quickly because it can affect to your own skills.

In conclusion

I disagree with Emerson, becasue you can still growing even if you are making a lot of mistakes, you can still achieve new things,you need to grow in person and in skills,always.

First, one reason to agree about positive attitude is believe in yourself.

If people have good attitudes that doesn't mean they don't have attitudes. Having good attitudes mean they have attitudes in a good way. My friend showed attitudes to different people in a different way. You can tell when people have bad attitudes or good attitudes. The good attitudes helps you to success in your life even when you have difficult time. The benefits of have good attitudes is you can success in your life, be happy, and have friends.

You can only success in your life by getting support from your family and your friends. Most of the people show their attitudes at school like one of my friend does. She never showed bad attitudes with her teacher or other adults but she does show attitudes with her friends but not bad way. She showed bad attitudes some time and good attitudes sometime. She think its fun because we are all same. She don't feel bad when she show us attitudes. She knows we are not going to feel bad for that. We all will help her out when she needed.

Like I said you can success in your life by getting support from you friends. If she have fake friends she knows they never will help her when she needed.

Be happy, I mean that by getting good grades at school. If you get good grades that mean everyone happy even your teacher. My friend, she always try to get our help before she ask her teacher. Is not that she is bad at school. Everyone get confused at something. I saw lots of difficult time at her life and we all tried to help. If she wasn't being kind to us no one would of friend with her. Also one time a teacher tried to help her to get good grades at class. She had C+ at class she needed only some point to get B- so that she can get A B honor roll. She request her teacher if she can help her out with it ,and her teacher gave extra point on test she took. Her teacher told her 'I only did that because you are a kind person.' 'I will love to help someone like you.'

Its not easy to make friends. Some people like to have friends who is kind to them, have good attitudes, have some similarities between each other. Some people make friends who has bad attitudes like them. They think talking with a nice person is embarrassing. Some people like having a good friends who never will leave them behind. If you make a friend who have bad attitudes all the time that means she/he is your fake friends. Also, a kind person can be also a fake friend. For example, when I moved into a new school I had friend. She always helped me. She was really polite to me. She helped me to find my classes, she helped me make new friends because I was a shy person. After some days letter there was a another girl moved in there. After that girl moved int here she never talked me. I tried to go talk to her but she didn't really care. Sometime when I saw her in the hall I said ""hi"" and she also said it back. After while she never even look at me. Its like she don't even know who I am. So yeah, its hard to find friend who really care about you.

E8B836196ADB,"I guess it's a good idea Because it helps the students to complete their homework with support from other people, with this club it will help a ton of students that has trouble or problems with their homework.

This will be a great idea for many students that has trouble doing their homework at home or doesn't understand or their stuck on their homework, but the other reason people don't want to add this club to the school is they don't like the idea of having it they say ""it's a waste of time for us"" or other more things that they say, some other students might say they don't have time for it or they don't wanna join the club. But it is a good idea to add this club for the students who don't understand how to do their homework, if other people don't wanna join they could just get a bad grade for not doing their homework. If you join the club for sure you will get a good score for doing your homework and probably get good grades for doing your homework because it helps you learn or practice at home for a test or a quiz, so maybe its a good idea to add this club to the school after school probably a few days, because it will be easy to complete your homework everyday and turn it in everyday if you join the club. If you join the club you could finish your homework early then your other classmates, if you do complete your homework early you could have free time at your house and not do any work cause you complete your homework early and not worry about doing work at home cause you already completed your work.",2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0
570595740274,"Do students need summer break or they can handle not have summer but with more breaks around the year?

Students need summer break because students like summer more than other other times in the year because is hot outside and it doesn't snow all the day also, during break some students can do things that they couldn't do because of the school. For example have a job, just enjoy and relax outside with family and friends or have big families plans that they were expected, students have more odds to do all that in summer because.

They can put all their effort in their jobs. almost all the students that I know have summer job in fact I actually have two summer jobs. For students have a summer job is actually very important and it means a lot because it can be the first thing that they actually put all their effort, and is not only the fact that they put all their effort it can be the fact that they can be helping their family for example.

Their mom is having a bad time at work, the sells went down, is being two weeks since the last buyer went to the store, is not something new at the store that could bring buyer, and is being a bad moth for their mom, their son will try to help her paying small things like the internet, the water, the light or he could actually do his best, paying all that and paying the rent of the house, some teenagers not only work in summer for their own good some teenager work for help their family with everything they can however. Sometimes they need relax, doing nothing or going out to eat, watch a movie with friends or family, or go to party with your friends and enjoy summer how I said, I have two summer jobs.

The first one is in construction and the second one is in a place called Generic_Name. My first week doing all that I feel tired and I feel that I couldn't do all that anymore but I realize that my family needed me and I keep doing it, in my first work I actually learn a lot about how to measure things and how to use a electric hammer also my boss is my uncle so I spend good time with him and I meet some really nice people. The second one is in Generic_Name I had to take care of kids, clean the place and make food, I meet really nice people there that helped me a lot and I realize that I like work with kids. However some students don't have a summer job and that is fine, some students likely have some family plans or plan with their friends that they want to do for summer like.

Go some to another country with you parents, sometimes parents have vacations at the same time that summer start if they change the vacations it will interfere with the time that students spend with their parents. Some students actually don't spend a lot time with their parents in fact I am one of those. our parents work to 8 AM to 8 PM and when they come back they are tired and they just wanna eat and go to sleep, and we understand why they are like that. In summer we spend time with out parents we go out to eat, we go to the movies or we go in a travel to another country that is the first reason why student prefer the vacations in summer than in another time of the year the second reason can be.

because of the sun, we all have to accept that we get tired of the cold, rain, snow and frozen rain we all get tired, and we want the sun also with the sun your garden won't die or it wont look ugly. Sometimes when we have summer some times another school from another country or another state have summer that means they could come here or we could go there and spend time with them. I actually have some friends from Venezuela and every time they have summer they come here to spend summer with me however.

Yeah sometimes it can be hard retain information but students need rest for while, spend time with their families and friends, and if they want it or they need it get a job and do their best.

Can they change vacations for another day or just have more different vacations but not that long?

No summer is not only the time where students rest, also is the time when they spend time with their parents or friends, it can be the time for some students to work and help their family.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0

When the summer break start,student can make a lot choices about their plan in the summer,for example,they can stay home,travel to somewhere,or work at some place they like;Most student's summer break have a lot different,they learn different things from their break,teacher could not really know what happen in student's break,this is why student need designed their own title.

In half way of the summer,some student might not even start making their project,in this cause if teacher give student a hard title,such as""after you read this book,what your opinion and what you learn from this book?"",then student have try rush through the book,and start making a project,it will make student have a bad project content,if student can decide they own project title,such as""base on your break,what you learn from your travel,it can be anywhere"",if student can create their own project title,it will be a lot interesting and easy.

Most student want to learn a new things from interesting activity,and spend a time on those things,and student always know what whey like to do,they can create title base on animals,vehicles,or their life experience,it will be so much fun and efficiency will improve,if they can decide their own project title.

F17DDEB77A2A,"Most students hope and enjoy a summer vacation after a long school year, but some educators thoughts are completely different as the way they should get their vacations. Although, during the summer break some students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, overall, the summer is a good season to have a school break because of the great weather and the posibilities to get a job for students.

Initially, we all know summer is the best season of the year, because it brings more attractions. Of course, the weather is one of the important factors that makes it possible. For example, amusement parks to entertain people, beaches's opening, as well as others entertainment places to go visit and have fun. Summer also is a known as a time where family can share moments with others and recover all the energies leaving the stress at home. Also many people likes the summer, beacuse you can practice any sport you want outside, a good way to decrease the percent of obesity and improve our helth. Another advantage of the summer is that we have more sun light during this season than winter, spring or fall, it allowing us to get done more stuff we need to do and being productive with our time. In short, the students's vacations should be in summer, because is a great season to do many activities and enjoy with friends and family.

In addition, as we have more attractions, more personal the companies need, which gives to many people the opportunity to get a job. As a students, a job is helpful in several aspects for good on their lives. For example, maturity, responsability , new experiences and connections-which is very important to your future. Each one prepares you as a person to deal with your every day lives. Also, students have enough time to save their money and keep it for their purposes, it can be for a college or buy whatever they want without the necessity to pay with their parents's money. As a result, students are aviable to gain their own money during the summer, because its offer more opportunities, and also gain new experiences that will help them move fordward.

Still, some may say that summer vacations are too long and there should be year-round schools, which would totaly change how long the breaks will be. Then, students can have a balence on their personal lives and scholar lives. The knoledge they aquired is still fresh in their minds so, new stuff to learn will be easier for them and consequently they will obtain good grades. In summary, the significance of the idea to administrate better how long, and the appropiate time for a break is to know if it are gonna affect the student progress, which is the priority of the school.

In conclusion, educators wants the best for students,and they just want to find out a better way to rise their progress making them as a better students improving their knoledges. But, it can becomes as an issue because if you are constantly over preassure, and studying all the time without an a consider time to free your mind, it will get you tired. Overall, the summer vacations will keep you distracted with many productive activities during a long break, which are gonna let you back to school more exited and willing to keep study.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
3898358B58BB,"To conserve energy and resources, Some businesses have adopted a four day work week, With each day consisting of ten hours. My school should not follow this model or even consider extending the school day by two hours. At my school a full day of school consists of seven hours. Seven hours is more then enough, Now having it to be nine hours would be very overwhelming for everybody. Extending it two more hours is too much stress on the students , as well as the teachers. Also most students have a part time job after school and won't fit everyone's schedule. There is a lot to do after school and extending school two more hours would not help. It also would not only affect the students but the teachers too. Some teachers have a second job to go to after school, Some teachers have children to go take care of at home. Also it is scientifically proven, That if students are in school for more than the seven hours they usually are in school, The students mind shut down. once the mind shuts down the body does too. So whenever the teacher is teaching the students isn't picking up the information and isnt learning anything. The student isnt focousing and also tired. So it would not benefit the students much , by adding the two hours. It will most likely have the students failing, because they're not leaning or doing their work.

B76C582FA08B,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. But are students really doing educational purposes? Should students really use their phones in their classrooms? Are students actually getting education? This is what I think about cell phones used in classes.

Most students get distracted by using their cell phones especially in class. I feel like every school should at least have laptops to give out for their students. It's more easier and less distracted. Because a lot of websites are blocked. Everyone gets distracted I know but thousand of teen are obsess with their phones. And if you're a teacher and let your student do their

""work"" in their cell phone, just know they might not be doing their ""work"" in their cell phones.

Some students might care more about their education then the things that's going on in life. Maybe not everyone feels the same, thinks the same, are the same. They might be capable to use their cellphones without getting distracted. Most of us can handle the distracting than others.

Most teachers actually let their students use their phones and don't really pay attention to their students. It might be our responsibility to be on track. But i feel like the teachers should at least stop us from getting distracted. Most students do get mad at teachers when the teachers stop us from using our devices. But do students know it for our own good.

When my parents take my phone away. I feel more free, relax, I feel good to be honest. I do get a bit mad at first. But then I think why they took it and how many time I lost. I feel like i'm back in reality and just leaving my moment god gave me. Honestly cell phones had ruined many peoples life's. Even toddlers these day all they do is come back from school and play on their parents cell phones or their losing sleep to watch videos .

I honestly don't think cell phones are healthy at all not even in education. Teachers shouldn't let their students use their phones at all. Only if it's in an emergency. Than that's when they should let them use it. But a real emergency. That's what I think about teachers letting their students use their cell phones during classes. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
F8FE459205F4,"Do you agree with churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

Should i agree that when someone fail and if they continuo doing what they were doing they will success later on?

I'm agree because when you make mistakes you'll learnd from it, and next time when you do it you will be better than what have you done in the past. If you are a failure and if you keep trying then i'm proud of you because thats the mean that you're in the good path and that you'll achive your goals soon. My reasons are nobdy is perfect and no one will be perfect ever, my second reason is even famous people have fail and now they're in the top, and my tird reason is there are some people who like to accomplish their dreams by working hard and never letting other people stop them.

To start with nobody is perfect, is because we all can make mistakes and also because it is okay to make mistakes, no one had died because they fail doing something like work from school or stuff from work. So it is like when you go to other country and you have to try new things like their languge, their food. their traditions and all the stuff that their country have and I konw that sometimes to feel like you'll never be like them, you'll never understand what they are saying, but it is false because I am a immigrant, I came to the United States when I was 14 years old not knowing any english, with only one person by my side that was my mom, and leaving everything behind. For one moment I think that I was never going to get used to this country, that I was never going to understand english and that I was never going to be enough to this country but now I can say that I can speak english I can writte in english and that all the people (brothers,and sister)

that I left behind I still love and that someday I will returned and I will tell them everything.

To continuo with famous people had failed in their past, and i'm saying this is people I know that to be where they are now they have done alot of work and they've done alot of sacrifices too like leaving their family behind because they did no support them or maybe because they didn't like that profession, friends becuase some of them are fake or maybe because they want to help them to progress, maybe schools need to be more focus about they work like wrinting songs or even focusing more in their dance, works because you need to choose the one that you like more, and I can tell that it did not stop them, they keep fighting to be better each day to give all the best about them to have a mentality about progress. I've seen alot of famous videos about people that I like and i've cried because some of their stories are really sad and I know what they where feeling that time. You can follow famous people and i admire them because they have fail millions of time and they've never stop doing what they love to do.

To finallice with that if you are one of those persons who like to accomplished dreams then you should never give up because thats what looser (mediocre) people do, they give up when they see that something is hard or maybe because they are shy about them how they look like if they are pretty or no or maybe because they don't like their work because the people is mean or their managge is agressive in the term how he express so they decide to quit. We always tried to put the best and to be the best of us even when you know that you can fail, that there are other people that are good too but you tried and you put effort on it so if you fail you'll know that you win because to did it and you finished it. You never can think that you are a failure if you didn't win, you can see that you are good in some other things where other people is no good. You will always have options you can choose if you want to tried hard or if you don't.

To conclude I am strongly agree that failure plays in the pursuit of success because nobody is perfect and if someone wants to be perfect then they'll need alot of work, we also know that even famous people have fail so if they have fail we should fail too beause then we will see what we had done wrong and we can fix it, and also even when it means that you need to leave that people that you love behind. Furthermore even though sometimes it takes a little too long to notified how much we have success and because we don't see that, we're mad with our lifes, we think that if we don't have a good possition at our work is because were not good enough but it is not truth because they are some people that doesn't have work or some others supplies and were complaining about our possition at work. It is not fair to have that kind of mind because we all should be happy with what we have and with what we can affort. Furthermore been a failure doesn't mean that you don't know how to do something or that you can not win. Been a failure means that for more that you fail the better you get and the more capacity you'll have later.       ",3.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

C444D6A0AC1C,"Although, many people believe that extracurricular activities can enrich students educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study and complete their homework assignments. This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldn't made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student don't want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities.

First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents don't wants to do the extracurricular activities. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. Some parents don't want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools.

Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student don't want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some student don't want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision.

Lastly, some student don't want to stay after school program or any other activities. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then it's up to their families choice, but most of students don't want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents.

This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. For me I disagree that school should not make a decision for students, decision should made by students families or by their parents for my three reasons. ",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5

I can admit I've have been several of times, In my opinion distance learning is a wonderful idea. Students can move at their own pase , you can replay the lesson video as much as needed , and it will prevent you from failing a class.

School can be stressful expecially when you miss a day and you feel like your behind on everything. Then when the teacher explains it to you , If you don't understand you might not want to ask for him/her to repeat it again. This can be avoided by the power of distance learning you'll be able to have classes online so you can move at your own paste. You wouldn't have to worry about asking a staff or classmate what you missed. Also you can take notes and do your classwork whichever way it works best for you.

However some students are visual and independent learners they focus better when they work by themselves. Working in a group at times might not always be the best option. When reviewing for a test or quiz you can go back and reread ,study, and take notes on whatever you're struggling with. Those notes can be reviewed as much as you want. If you're a type of person that has to have things repeated to you multiple times this is a great opportunity for you.

Last but not least , Are you failing a class due to not having enough time to turn your work in? You would probably not have to worry about that anymore because you can do your work at anytime. In class you are given a time limit you have to turn in your assigment. When your doing it online yes im sure there is a due date but you're not told what time your suppose to start at. If your at sports practice or have any free time you can start working on it. In my opinion this will prevent you from failing a class because you can turn it in whenever your ready to.

To sum it up this is an amazing opportunity alot of students should be looking to attend. If your school is offering this to you I highly recommend it. It can keep you on track and motivate you to complete and turn your work in on time so you don't fall behind in class. You can move at your own paste without anyone rushing you. And lastly, you can replay and reread anything as you would like with no limits. This is a big help for students who want to reach their goal of earning a diploma.

In many schools districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. This program make students to take classes that can help them to graduate on time, and many student take courses during the summers or in the evening. This is a bad idea making students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school.

First, when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course. For example, many students are interesting in elective courses, but they not got enough time to taking elective courses because they are take the basic courses for they can graduate on time. When students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting. In conclusion, students need four years in high school for they can take courses where they are interesting and they can start to grow up in that courses.

Secondly, student are not joy in they last year of high school. For example, school where are make student to graduate in three years, in they last year student have to take courses and SOL for they can graduate on time, if they dont past students most retake, and this make students frustrate. This program is making students to rush. But if they fail any classes that make students add more classes to they last year and all this make student to no joy they last year in high school. In conclusion, Last year for students don't have to be the worse year.

In other hand, there are people say, student just need three year in high school, for student can enter college or the work one year early. They argument, that student with three year are ready to graduate and enter college or the work, because many student may finish with their courses and SOL in their third year and the last year they don't do nothing. This argument is incorrect because in the four year students are doing what they need to finish and they planing where they wants to go if college or work. For example, students want to graduate on time, and they need to catch up or retake anything they can do it in the last year. In conclusion, student need a four year of high school for they can get anything what they have to be done.

In conclusion, put this program in school is a bad idea because make students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school. Because when students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting and student are not joy in they last year of high school.

CD5F70E5C1D7,"To begin with, in my opinion i think students and parents should get the choice to be involved in any type of extracurricular activties. and why im saying this is because the school does not have no right to tell you you can do this and that but if they ask you to stay to finish some school asignments or afterschool studying then i suggest you stay after if you really want to finish those assignments and get a good or decent grade on it. or if you want to do great in school or in any job and you need a lot of school for that type of job then you might want to do as much of extracurricular activites.

Second of all, if the parents dont think that you are going to do good enough in school after the extracurricular activites and if you dont have enough time for study sessions or you homework because your to tired from sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. then ask your teacher or whoever is controlling the activties and ask them if you can get off a little earlier because you dont have enough time for homework, studying, or FAMILY or for yourself or your friends.

but i think the school should give the students and thier faimly diffrent choices of extracurricular activties so the students can pick 2 or 3 diffrent types of them instead of not having time for thier own life. like the students can pick and choose the 2 or 3 they really want or like to do or they can pick the ones that's going to help them the most in the future of school or in thier adult life, because teachers can teach the students things from extracurricular activites that they learned or did so they wont have to ask no one else for help or hire somebody then from that you can save money and you can also get money if you help someone that doesnt know how to do that type of thing.

And thats why i think it should be the students and parents choice if the students want to or not do extracurricular activities. because the school doesnt think about the students family or what they got going on at that time they just want to boss the kids around and tell the students to go ot not go.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you can't stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because he's so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two.

The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you don't then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff.

The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you don't have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble. Then college is for you and you don't have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you can't stop because people that put the work they don't stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others don't because the were born with golden life.

Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something don't have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing. some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didn't so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that don't wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it.

BF267B42A2A4,"The humanity now in days had been not so good lately, there is many different opinions on how you should do things in life or how you should act. It is well informed that people can be complicated but nobody will said the life will be easy all the time. I think people should start making their own decision because, they can learn about life, have a better understanding on how life works and how to value their-self and be efficient person on their own.

However, there is a big chance that people can tell you how you really should live your life, you have to experienced it in persons there will be a day when you are going to fall or something can happen you are not aware on how life can be so hard and difficult in times. Also mistakes are allow nobody is perfect life will surprise you anytime without you notice it you got to be ready to face it not matter how easy or hard it could be. When you make your owns decision you will be capable of making the right decision for yourself.

Meanwhile, it is hard to understand life sometimes but is part of our daily life and you have to understand how it really works so the way you do not stress out for a simple thing, life gives you challenges that only you as the only responsible of yourself have to face it and all will depends how you take things it will be a result of it. As we grow life will make us stronger or weak it all depends but best choice of making the right thing is that you should be aware that anything can happen without given you a hint it will hit you on the right time or not on the best time you wanted it. Anything that will hurt you will make you strong and that's how you know that your are living life.

Lastly, people might not notice it but if we do not love ourselves nobody will do it, people do have to depend on some else to be happy it's all about you. In addition anything you do will not make others happy you have to learn to do everything on your own because that more efficient you are the more good things in life you will make. Be your own and value every single thing that is around, but remember nothing is easy life can surprise you anytime.

In conclusion, people should start making their own decisions to be aware of what life really is if your learned and have a better understanding about life in a daily routine anything that will happen will not surprise you. Loving yourself will make you love others. Hopefully people will take a note that life is all about you and not others each person has a different thoughts and ways of seen life.

E974548BFD00,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow"". Doing something that you have already mastered means that you won't grow. I agree with what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because it is always good to try new things. Would you want to try something new and master it or keep doing the same thing?

First, people can challenge themselves with new things so they can experience life with obstacles. Challenging themselves means that they will try to do something even when its hard. Challenging people with hard things means that they are not going to give up even when it gets hard. Why wouldn't you want to challenge yourself with new things?

It's good to try new thing because doing something that you have already mastered is good but what about trying to master something else. If you want to grow even more it would be better to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things.

Also, Having more experience with life means that you are growing up. Growing up means that you would have to try new things and not only stick to one subject. Wanting to try new things in life is good because your brain functions better and you get more knowledge. You will have more knowledge in your brain which means that you could master more and more things. Mastering something is good because you get to have more self esteem and you will feel good about yourself. Feeling good about your self is really important because you will need the motivation to master something in life. You can't master anything without having motivation because then it will be a mess and it wont turn out good.

Therefore, wanting to try new things is good because you can be open minded. You can also have many ideas that you could jot down. Wanting to try new things gives you a lot of ideas on what you want to master. In the process of thinking of an idea to master you get so excited that there is a lot of planning and ideas in your head on what to master in. It is always good to feel confident because without confidence and motivation you wont have the energy to do what you originally wanted to do in the first place. Trying new things is also good for your social life because you will come in contact with people that has so many creative ideas and you can talk to them and they would probably help you on what your ideas can be.

However, not challenging yourself with new thing,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things may not be good you could end up being comfortable at where you are at. Being comfortable is good but not challenging yourself to do whats best is bad because your not giving yourself enough credit. If you don't work hard to master something that you truly want to master in then there is no point in trying to master it. If you dont try to master in anything you wont have any hope and you will become lazy and you will stop trying the hard work that you are trying to do. Trying new things is apart of life and if you don't do that than you would struggle a lot in life.

In conclusion, challenging yourself,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things is better than being comfortable at where you are at in life, being lazy,stop trying,and don't want to try new things which means that you will start struggling in life. having new experiences is better than only having old experiences because with new experiences you have a fresh start and a clean plate. You get to have a better life because you're going to be having a lot of things that you would want to master. Giving up is never the right thing because than you wont get anything you want. You have to work in order to get what you want because life doesnt give you anything for free. Many people want to grow and do other things so that they can master at it. Wouldn't it be cool if you were the first person to master anything you wanted? ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
9145AB74E1DA,"I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help.

The students phone can be used as caculators for their math class. In history class the students can search for the answer and write it down on their paper. If the teacher wants to do an phone activate the students can use their phone to do that activate. The Students will be more active on their work if they had their cell phones with them in school.

In a math class the students can use their phones as caculators for educational purpose in case their actual caculator ran out of batteries. The students will have to use their phone in order to work on their math problems. The students can also use their phone to make a straight line so the students can do their work fast or running out time for their class. The teacher can give the students to take pictures on the board so they can remeber what their work is on tomorrow. Cell phones can be used in many things math class it can help students in their time of need.

In history class cell phones can benefit you if you use it right. Incase the teacher wants you to go on a cite to see which year was it that brought us here and get the answer. If theres a time when a student is about to leave early they can ask their teacher to let them to take picture of the board so the student can write down on their notebook. The teacher can also bring in a fun activate thats related to their class and the students phone so they can play kahoot. If the student wants to know whats happening around the world they can look on CNN 10 for answers. Cell phones can be a real benefit for the students if they given the ability to use their phone for educational purpose.

People might have some disagree meants with the use of cell phones. They might think that it's an distraction for students when they use it. The students need to read books so they can actually get the answers. Some other people might say that cell phones can cause some cheating for their quizzes or test. The that their are some people might say that, not all students can be that way.

In conclusion cell phones should be used for educational purpose so the students can be more active when they are on their phones. If the teacher allows the students to use their cell phones it can bring a lot of interactions with the students. The students can education can be improved because of the use cell phones. The use of cell phones can make school a little bit more fun. The students will be excited when it comes to usuing their phones kahoot will be great the students use it.

89ADE1CC1BEC,"In my opinion, students should not use their phones in classrooms. The students will get distracted . Also, students should keep away their phones for safety. Lot of students can't stay without cellphones; however, they should know the without phones in classroom they will learn more.

First, Students will get distracted if they have their phones in classroom.

They will be texting in class, and they will be on social media while the teacher is explaining. Furthermore, some students spend their class time, playing video games, watching movies, or videos on YouTube. It also distract other students that really wants to learn. Sometimes, the teacher allows students to use their phones in classes for educational purpose; however, the students take advantage because they use that time for playing some music on YouTube or taking pictures around the class, so I would not recommend teachers to let them use their phones in classes. I remember the time when I was in 9 grade, I often used my phone in classroom. I thought it would not affect my grades; however, at the end of the semester I saw only D in all of my classes. I stopped using my phone in class, and my grades were getting better.

Second, students should keep away their phones in classes for safety. I believe that no one is perfect and there are some students who doesn't have a good behavior in school, so they use their phone for taking inappropriate pictures. In addition, we have seem some examples in other schools about terrorism, and we don't know what students do outside or what kind of friends they have out of school, so the student inside of school may be stay in contact with terrorist outside of the school in case of any terrorist attack. The teacher will be thinking that his or her students are reading about the topic in the class, but the true would be that students are using their phone in a different purpose.

The Department of Education should establish a law about not allow students to use their phones in classroom or not use it at all in schools because they won't be able to pay attention, and because is a good way to keep safety in the school. Some may say, students need their phones in class for search information or call for any emergency; however, students don't need their phone when the school provides computers for searching any information, and they don't need their phone for emergency because the school provides police officers and good strategies to protect them in case of any emergency.

FAB189F7E4DF,"Have you ever do something bad in your life , and your friends influence you to do it ? well everybody has two types of friend one with good behavior and the other with bad behavior. But the teenagers of this time never think in consequences when they are following bad examples. So I believe that a good example by your own behavior is the best way to infuence other people because people learn things by examples, or if you get together with somebody who is not a good influence for you believe or not your are going to learn what he does. People is always around you they are always looking what you do and they are criticizing your actions.

My first reason is because good behavior is the best way to influence people because if you are a smart person, educated , and happy your are going to be a example for other people and they might said that they want to be like you. Many teenagers has ruin their life for following bad influences. People can said that we are old enough to know what is good or wrong but we never think from what is coming. The world is full of bad person and some people would ask their self, why there's too many bad people in this world? the answer is because people is influencing others to do bad stuffs. If human wants a better world for their kids they have to be good influences, good examples to the new generation that is coming.

In my own experience I have seen friends and relatives that has ruin their life for getting together with people that is a bad influence for them. Is really sad when you see somebody that is in jail or dead for following bad examples by having bad friends. When you are following a bad example that person never is going to tell you what are the consequences. As you can see babies when they are in the age of learning new things they do what their parents do or what they teach them to do. Adults and teenagers are a little bit different because not all the time we do what people tell us to do, but we always end up learning something of that person.

People is always criticizing so if you don't want to that happen be a good example. Being a good influence people would trust in you, but being the opposite of that nobody would trust in you. And when we realize is too late because the people you appreciate are separating from you for been a bad influence for others or maybe for them. My grandma always said , "" what you crop, you would sow."" For me those phrases mean a lot because being a good example or having a good behavior will take you to succeed in life , and is not just that there are many ways to succeed in life too.

For these reasons I believe that a good example is the best way to influence others so the people that is learning or looking what you do can learn good things about you and by that wat can trust in you. Also you will feel proud of yourself that your are influencing other in a right way.

5F1183463E9D,"Thinking ahead of time of what you want to do after high school before you start high school may or may not be a good idea. For example it might get you prepared for what classes you can take your first year of high school. Because high school is all about getting good grade and getting the help you need to become what you want to become in life. High school is where you get your real start to your future. And here are some reasons why.

Thinking about what you want after high school before you even start could be beneficial to you. For example for some it might come as motivation. As in they are at a low point in life where things arent going so great, they could think about what they want tot do and see them selves in the future becoming what they wanted to become. It could even benefit you your first year of high school like picking your classes. You would pick the classes that are most related to the career you want to pursue. Another big thing that is good about looking into what you want to do before high school is the collages as well. Some collages might have the the class you need to finish and major in what you are studying for. It is like a head start on one the classes you take in high school, two the rest of your high school years, three the collage you want to get into.

But there are always some downs to thinking and or knowing what you want to do before you even get to high school. Such as there might not be a class for what you want to major in. Or you might not be eligible for taking that class , they could be over booked in those classes. There might be mix ups with your schedule that may cause you not to get the class you wanted. Even when you have your mind set on one thing for your future your opinion may change over time it may even change completely. And it happens to a lot of students. They make up there minds and then maybe weeks later it may change into something else. There are also other issues with what you want to do in your future. Some students work full time jobs and its hard for those students to focus on one goal and keep up with school work , Sometimes even miss school just because of work. If you think about it even after graduating high school some still work and move on to collage and are still stuck in the mud with work and even harder homework and class work. So dont have a ride to school or even work. Money is a big issue as well. With having to pay for a car or even other life needs you might not be able to get into the collage you want to get into because of how expensive it is. There are student loans but you still have to pay that back and sometimes you can be late on payments but then that doubles and no one wants that.

High school is where your future really begins really. Because if you think about it is where you start learning about where to get your start , how to start , when to start . This is where we as students decide what we want to do in life and where we want to go with it . And if we chose to chance our dream that thats where we end p with hard work and dedication.                   ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
4C17DB6FF2DC,"John Lubbock quotes on choosing your own character or letting influences form your is a passage I can live by.

For the reason of it being actually true because, sometimes things you see throughout your life would change your character. The people you look up to can can your character because you want to be just like them. but sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence.

Things you see in life can change your character. Lets say you are in the streets and you get into a car accident then you are gonna have a chance to be afraid to drive a car. It can also be changed by a bad experience, lets say you are in an abusive relationship after that relationship ends you would think every girl/guy is an abusive person.

What if you are living in foster care and you never get adopted you will think that you will never among to nothing and be nothing your whole life.

The people you look up to can have a dramatic change in your character. Let's say your father is your biggest inspiration you will want to be just like him when your older and follow in his foot steps. But, if your inspiration isn't anyone in your family but it is a famous sport player you will grind your butt off just to be in the same team with them and hopefully play along side with that player. Newer influences these days are trough social media and movies and in my opinion those are the worst ones because they usually trying to sell you something or market something to their audience.

Sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Having a bad influence can lead to a lot of trouble and you can even end up in jail for it. Let's say you look up to your father and he is a very toxic person and a violent person and you end up like him that's not a good thing. Also something that can happen is that you look up to a very bad very disturbing person and he likes to hurt people and then you start hurting people because you want to be just like him. Depending on who your inspiration is it will develop the way your character comes out.                  ",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

I dont particularly agree with that quote jsut because in certain problems even if you try your best you will still fail or if you just dont want to do the problem or other people around you dont then you most likley fail to. What im trying to get at to this quote is that instead of being ""For every problem there is a chance for you to do your best"" it should be ""For every problem or challenge there is always a way to get thorugh it"". Here is a few examples: If your dying from old age and your deadline is going to be this week. Then just die you get around the challlenge by dying because in most relgions there is something called heaven so you can die and go to heaven. Another example: Facing a hard question, just guess!

Something else why I disagree is because parents might want you after school for something and if you come from school late them can't do what your parents are telling u want to do.

Some reasons why I disagree is because you might have to do thing after school. Something are you might have sports practice for a team or for clubs. Another reason why is because some students have family things to do out of school and it would be for a long time. Some student would have doctor appoints and that is very important.

Another reasons why I disagree is because student will get bored in school. Some student can start to get mad try to leave the school and get in trouble and the student can get in a fight. Something else is that student can fall asleep and not pay attention to the teachers and they can get trouble as well as the student can stay even longer. Something is that they would not be able to learn if they fall asleep.

I think we can control our character traits because we can choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think we choose our character traits.

For example, I think we choose our character traits like being quiet. Being quiet isnt a good or bad thing like you can be quiet sometimes not all the time because you got to talk once in a while. You have to balance it all out. I remember back when i was i middle school 6th to 7th grade I was a quiet kid with little friends like I would not talk to no one. I felt so alone because of that, then I started talking to people and got lots of friends. So, I think we can control our character traits. Thats why I think we choose our character traits like being quiet.

Also, another example is being social. Being social is a great thing to have because talking to people is good like you can make friends, learn new things. and even discover new things. I was a very talkative kid in 7th to 8th grade I remember that I felt like I was annoying to some people because i talked a lot. I also learned new things like how to approach and talk to people. I discover new things to like I discover that people can change over time. Some are nice then they turn moody or mean, and others were mean then nice. Some people dont change and that happens to thats how the world works. Thats why I think we can control and choose our character traits like being social.

Therefore, my next example is being a over yourself. like being confident or keeping yourself in check thats a good trait to have. It can be also a bad trait because you can be over confident and cocky. Some people dont like those kind of people because they say ""there no fun"" or they are ""party poopers."" I'll confess that I was a little cocky and over confident when it came to sports because i was a very competitive kid. Sometimes I even screamed and yelled of happiness because I scored or won a game. Some people also think thats our character traits are influence beyond our control, and yes I can see there point of view because, when I screamed and yelled when I scored or won I game i didnt control it i just yelled. I could've not yelled I could've just celebrated with my hands and look up in the sky but I didnt do that. This is why I think we can choose our character traits like being over yourself.

Finally, I think when the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" He though one of two things he thought we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control. I think he thought we choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think he thought about we choose our character traits.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
C265A20FB301,"Yes. I agree with Ralph Waldo statement becuase it is true you got to farther than what you already know if u wantto succed in life you got to go farther then what you feel capable of doing life for example: i have a frienmd who plays soccer he used to stay playing difence i was like yo Generic_Name u should trry out on playing forward, he was like i don't know i have never played forward only defence, so i was like life is not about staying in one place life is all about going out there and do things you feel like you can't because u cant stay in one flace for the rest of your life; and know hes one of the best forward players my school have, life is not about just doing things u can life is all about experimenting new things to do something out of your limits to see what else are you good at because its a good feeling when you find out of what you capable of.

When you go out of your limits, you can find out lot of things about your self you get to know who the real you is, you get to know how inteligent, how brilliant you is to do things out of your rutin of every day we only live life ones but we live every day with out knowing if we going to wake up the next day, on my opinion i do agree with Ralph Waldo on his statement.

28FF89DC3B40,"Have you ever had some tell you that you have to play a sport or get involved with clubs or an activity? Would you agree or disagree to participate in any activity in school? I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family.

My first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worried about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved.

There for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates.

My final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no one wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did. But in the other hand there are kid that only see their parents once cause they come from work very late and go to work very early and you have to go to sleep cause there is school the next day. It would be very dad to not even see your parents or talk to them or even give them a huge or say i love you. And your dont get to do though stuff cause you are at school doing sports or in a club.

This is why i disagree that student should have to participant in an activity. There are so many stuff that student might have to do out of school that makes them not be able to join a club,sport or any other activity that they offer in the school.              ",3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
F1F6D7CAE400,"I am agree with Churchill's statement about that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Failure plays an important role in the pursuit of the success. We learn of our owns mistakes, including others persons mistakes. At the same time, is very important to be enthusiasm and with a good attitude to address and learns of ours mistakes, to continue progressing in the pursuit of success.

If we do not try, we do not make mistakes,

if we do not make mistakes, we do not learn, and we will not be success as we want to. It is so important that when we make a failure. With enthusiasm,

checking where did we fail, how can we fix it, and give the best of our self. You can see, that how the next time that you pass with the same circumstances, you will not make the same failure that you did the last time, and at the time you will became an expert according at the area you are trying to perform.

Do not let the fear of going from failure to failure, prevent you of pursuit the success. Every vary make mistakes that is why, it is very important that we do not have to loss the enthusiasm. The enthusiasm is what make us, to stand up, learn of our failure, and continue pursuit the success, do not matter which one, or how it is the circumstances of our failure.

At the same time you can learn of the failures of others persons. that way you do not have to pass with same circumstances that they pass before; and you can economize your time to success faster. Listening, reading and paying close attention of what other person transmit about their failure can help us more then what can we think. Imagine the much you can get just for give some of the minutes of your time, to listen the important things you can get from the failure of others. so open your mind and pay attention.

In conclusion it is good to failure. Every time we make a mistake, we learn about it, and we will never forget what we learn from them. Therefore do not let a failure prevent you to be success, and learn of your failure and other people failure.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0
40DB9B4FC90A,"Our good behavior is something the motivate us as a way of thinking or, feeling as one on self to be someone important in our life. Because, it described us by having a good conduct, a positive personality, and a attitude. This is something the help us to have a good success in life. Because if we want to do something in our life we always need to be positive.

My first reason is having a good conduct it help us to be a better person, every where we go. Because, is going to be useful

For example: If the students go to the school every day; they have to behave with the teachers. They need to be respectful with them. We must do everything that they say because, we are smarter people to understand what is good and bad for us.

My second reason is a positive personality is also important. It help us to be more successful. For example: If we are taking a test; we always need to be positive instead of being negative or, if we have bad grades we can asked the teacher to help us. We must do our home works, and extra works so we can improved our grades.

My third reason is a good attitude is also important because it described who we are. For example: I helped my friend friend to find a new job were I work. So, she got a interview for the job. I told her to have a good attitude so they will might accept her were I work. I think is important to help others.

We always need to have a good attitude so we can be someone in our life. Because, we are smarter people, and we know what is important for us. Also is going to help us to be successful in life. We most be positive and do what is important to us. ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5
3691B4714FD5,"Conserving energy and resources, this is what the most part of the society is worried about, some bussineses are even adopting a four-day work week, each day consisting of ten hours; but should schools apply this model by extending the school day two hours? Well, I belive that schools should adopt this model because: It gives students a longer weekend to vacation, or simply to their favorite activities, second reason would be learning part, students will have a longer period of time for each class, which means they can learn farter, or memorize it easier; then we have the most important; the resources and energy saving.

Almost every student loves to have a loger weekend, one example could be my neightbor Generic_Name; he loves to go camping on weekends, sometimes he tells me, he wish to have a longer weekend, that would allow him to go even further or simply to stay loger at the same place, I am pretty sure that the three days weekend would make him happy, others may also be thankful, because they will have more time to do their homework or just to study. Me, as an example, I rather to stays at home and study; sometimes, I feel like the weekend went off a lot faster than the usually.

The second reason, which is so important for students, I belive it is; the longer classes that we will have, this will make a great impact on the grades of the students, longer classes will make us learn quicklier,Generic_Name my brother is one of those student that forget some important things about any class, I always tell him, ""Generic_Name study, do your homework,"" and he has already forgotten what the homework was about, I belive Generic_Name will get better and remember the homework with the loger period of classes; also in my class of science, sometimes the whole class is experimenting with some wird liquids, and we are still mixing when, the bell rings, my theacher, Generic_Name, says, ""it would be greatful, if we would have more time so we would be able to finish the experiments,"" and of course! the entire classe agree with what he says.

Some people might say that students would forget somethings during weekend, however the four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources; there is a massive wave of air polution in this world, and one of the biggest is fosil fuel, millions of kids are dropped to school by their parents, if we start coming to school a day less; it would casue a great impact over the polution, it could reduce polution a lot, also the government will save a lot of money in terms of food sources, every day, schools give tons of food just for students, a non-classes friday could help to save that much resources.

As a conclusion, I belive schools should adopt this four-day school week because; it will make students to enjoy the new schedule, the three-days weekend, this will give more time to do our favorite activities or to study. It will also give us longer classes, where we could have bigger activities without being worry about the time, at least not as much as before, but it will be enough, and my last one which I belive the most important, society will have less air polution, and also the the government will save a lot of money if we get the four-day schoool.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

I See no problem not a big essue about using cell phones at school,a lot of students need the cell phones to stay informed or to keep in contact with the parents,students can use cell phone in case of an emergency at school. Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at this times. Some students don't have a way to search a subject or a problem because they don't have a computer with,so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through,share ideas with other students,point of view about a subject,political opinions,stay informed what is going on outside of school,students have to be informe about everything that happens outside of school,bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again,and get what they want .I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for this reasons.

However, some students can take to other side,and don't pay atenttion in class because of the cell phones,a big part use cell phones to play games,or get distracted with music,and this can affect a lot of other students in the class,use to much of the cell phones also affect the social midia. Using social midia at school can cause a bad point of view of the school,examples of it can be recording fights, or sexual things. Most teachers don't allow studenst using cell phone during class because students can be out of the subject that the teacher is trying to teach,this can be a rock inside the boot.

C41E40F2D803,"Do you know how many careers' choices you have when you enter to high school? Most of the new students in high start thinking about what career they would like to take after they finish high school. Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure, actually students should commit to a career at a young age because help students to preparate for the future and they have more time to choose the career they like.

Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure. In most cases students become stressed because of their parents telling them to start selecting a career at a young age. Students behavior change; However their grades get affect it bacause of the stress and pressure. Some people say that school should talk to students' parents, so students don't feel pressure selecting a career at a young age. When the parents know they have a lot time before collage.

First reason why students should commit a career at a young age because help students preparate for the future and let them know what is better for them. Students preparation is base on saving money to pay for collage. They can see what is better for them; In other words what career benefit them more and if they allowed to pay it. Students can know early where they can get help either from their parents, or if they has to work for the career that they want. Students can talk with their parents aboout a student loans too.

Second reason why students should commit a career at a young age because they have more time to look for a career that they like more. They have more time to look for a career with the charateristics they like. Students have more time to save money. They can know other careers where they can get a good pay. Teachers can help students to get a good career base in their Knowledge.

In conclusion students should commit a career at a young age bacause as I said helps the students to preparate. The time is one of the best reason that help them.

Imagination it's what sparks our creativity. Without imagination, knowledge means nothing because we wouldn't be able to come up with anything. How we create intricate characters and stories and how incredible buildings stand tall. This is due to imagination and how we come up with such things. Take a second and think of your favorite character from any source of media. They were created because someone imagined them and brought them to life. Imagination is all around us from our stories and music to our basic everyday items. That pen on your desk was imagined up to be able to write and pass along information.

For ages people imagined stories and people listened. People and imagined plays,movies,books,TV and video games all with different stories and design. These things may seem insignificant, but people adore these stories and have been inspired. They have been mesmerized by these worlds and characters. Imagination is what leads people to create these stories. These stories have taught us messages and life lessons also. They inspire us to be best version of our self and to follow our dreams, as we see the characters do. We grow close to characters and relate with them, making these stories more special to us. Imagination gave us inspiring role models and heroes, they also gave us a childhood. How we wait to see our favorite cartoon and smile with excitement waiting for the next adventure to unfold. Imagination gave life to unforgettable characters, how Walt Disney created Micky Mouse and countless other. These characters and stories aren't just for children but adults as well. Stories of all genres exist to bring new experiences and worlds to the audience. Imagination gave us stories to inspire,scare,to make us laugh or even cry for the character. Imagination gave life to countless of stories something knowledge could never do alone.

From the Eiffel Tower to an small little house, people imagined buildings and ways to construct them. It's true you need to understand and know how to build but imagination is more important. Imagination is what let us think of such designs. Even in ancient times people put imagination and knowledge to build a house. Whether it's building a mud house or straw hut people imagined putting all of it together and put it in action. How people designed cars for transportation and made it function properly. Engineers are creative and imaginative to come up with such intricate designs and models. Even everyday objects were imagined and made to help you in everyday life. Whether it's a juicer to a wrench, people imagined these things to serve a purpose. How biomechanics creates prosthetic arms and legs to help the disabled to move again. Theses things all started as thought to help society and now are a vital part in today society. Imagination is what led man kind to create items to help us in everyday life.

Music is an form of art where people express their emotions through song. Instruments were imagined for the sole purpose to create art. Then playing the instrument led to more creative thinking, then songs were imagined and instruments added to that. Songs are written with heart and they express the artists' emotions. They are imagined and written down, sometimes using metaphors to express their emotions. People say that they can say things through music that they couldn't say with words. Being able to imagine such meaningful songs that leave a such an impact on the listener is incredible. Music speaks to people in a way words can't and the artist that make them are imaginative people.

Imagination led these artist to produce such songs and music. Painting is an other form of imaginative art. These artist express themselves by using strokes of paint to produce vibrant works of art. Even though a painting is silent people speak through them to show such meaningful works of art. Artists imagine what they want to paint and execute and you can see such a passion in their works of art. Imagination inspires artist to create outstanding pieces of art.

Imagination also expresses itself in the way we dress and life style. For the most part we choose the way we dress,where we work and what we do. When not in uniform or work clothes we choose how we dress. We imagine ourselves a certain way and choose to expresses ourselves that way. Our hair and how we choose to style it also reflects our personality. Whether it's colored,straight,curly or even no hair at all. We also imagine what we want in our lives and choose to study for that career. Our hobbies and interest also show what kind of person you are. How you spend your free time is how you reflect yourself. Our appearance and hobbies are a self reflection of our imagination and who you are. Imagination makes you who you are, and that's what makes everyone a different person.

Imagination might not seem important but it's what allows people to create stories, construct buildings, create items,produce music,to make art and makes you. We need imagination even more than we need knowledge. Without imagination there wouldn't be a way to put our knowledge to use. Imagination is the fuel of the world, it's what keeps everything going. It may seem insignificant at first but imagination is so such more. Without imagination no advancements would be made. We need imagination to do almost everything life. Imagination is what makes us human. Imagination over mind.        ",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5
2286BCFF86EB,"Generic_Name was sitting in the cafeteria listening to music refusing to touch her plate of food, why was she like that?

Well, she was worried that everyone had their specific career picked out before going to high school and she was the only one that didn't. Students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will feel pressured at a young age and students will change their career options as they take different courses.

First, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will feel pressured at a young age. For example, my friend Generic_Name wanted to become an astronomer but her parents wanted her to be an engineer, she felt pressured and didn't know what courses to take. During class time Generic_Name's teacher gave everyone in the class a paper to write the possible classes they wanted to take their first year of high school, but unfortunately Generic_Name didn't know what classes to take. While Generic_Name was still thinking her teacher approached to her and told her that both science and math courses connected to the careers she was debating to become, she also told her that after taking those classes she was gonna be able to pick the class she favored the most and go for that one. Some people believe that committing to a career at a young age will help students develop and make them smarter but they are incorrect because committing at a young age will cause students to have a lot of stress and give them less opportunities to join other classes.

Second, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will change their career options as they take different courses. For example, Generic_Name was looking forward to become a professional soccer player but he knew he had a 20% chance of becoming one. One day during class time Generic_Name started to think about a serious career that he can actually accomplish and put extra time and work. He decided to become a history teacher; He enjoyed learning history so much that he thought about becoming the one to teach others history as well. Generic_Name was so pleased with his choice that he payed close attention on everything Generic_Name said and never hesitated to raise his hand and ask for more questions. Generic_Name took all the history classes he needed to take, he also joined debate class and a public speaking class therefore he would become better at public speaking and not be afraid to talk in front of others. A month later Generic_Name thought about how good he'll be if he became an attorney. Generic_Name definitely knew how to speak in front of others after taking the public speaking class and he also knew how to defend a case so he changed his career option and decided to stick with attorney.

Another example is that Generic_Name wanted to be a dog sitter but she was also interesting in the study of the human body and how it worked, so she decided to join a a psychology class and learn more about it.

In conclusion, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will get a chance to pick the career they want as they take different courses in high school and it will also cause many students to feel pressured at such a young age. Students should know that they have all the time they need to learn and be curious about any class they put their interest into, as they grow up their brain will develop therefore they will become more smarter and they will have the chance to pick the career to want to be in.

F591A84185A4,"I was thinking to work at the police station because I can work on cases that could allow me to travel around the world and some cases that can be cool and super fun. It would be fun to work at the police station because you can travel to different countries and cities you have never been to. Therefore, you can explore from above when riding a air plane and you can meet different people. Also experience of what type of cultures people do in their country.

Working at the police station would be cool and super fun because I can work on fun cases, involving to ride different vehicles or going undercover and going places. Just imagine your manager assigned you to go to Korea and you stayed there for a few years. You have made new friends and learned the Korean language. You had to take Tae Kwan Do and you made it to black belt. However you still work with the U.S. police. And you also observe of what they do in Korea, for example, how they harvest rice and at what type of climate they need to be in or how the people eat their food and how younger children greet the older men and women. Also experience what people do in their specific culture and what laws they follow and things they need to respect. And also how they sell to get money.

Also working with police means you are not alone, you have teammates with you. They can also help you on cases that can be dangerous. Your teammates can be helpful and fun because they can help make wise decisions and on something risky, like you have their back and they have yours. They can also be help and caring/fun when you are stressed out and they try to make you feel better or trying to comfort you and not making you feel lonely. For example, On one Sunday morning you felt sick and a strange feeling you had something missing. You ate breakfast and you remembered you needed to finish on one of your assignments your manager had gave you. you felt even more sick. All day you tried to erase the fact that you didn't complete you assignment, you tried to throw that thought away, but you couldn't. You wanted to not even think about and wishing the thought could just disappear. You felt like brain was rotting for thinking too, much. You called you best friend ( that also worked at the police station:) because you wanted some company. When she entered your apartment, she saw that you weren't in the living room. She went to your bedroom noticed that you had been eating junk food all day because you had lots of your favorite corn chips and an empty box of pizza beside you. Just then she started to stare at you, and you were reaching for a bucket of your favorite ice cream, strawberry. She looked at you and saw that you scooped a spoonful of ice cream and you shoved it into your mouth, with your TV on. (You were watching the Titanic with the lights off because you felt sad and had nothing to do) She went up to you and hugged you and asked what has happened to you and why you were feeling down. You told her why you were so miserable and guilty for not finishing your assignment. She stoop up and told you that she was going to help you. You also stoop up lazily, but you felt excitement. You went to go change and finished the assignment on time. This is why it's a good thing to be friends at work for you can't be so lonley.",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

Some people doesn't care because they don't understand what are they talking about like sports or something.

You guys can play sports with each other. For example, there was 2 people in a park and they saw each other and both of there favorite color is blue and they became best friends and played sports that they each liked. I has a friend when I didn't know before also he was very athletic, he was the same kind as me but i'm not really a athletic person. I talked to him and said hi, ""he said"" hi back so normally. I told him can I play and he said sure and after that we became good friends.

It can help you out, they can believe in you, and you guys can play sports with each other so thats why small acts of kindness has an impact.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0

Some school doesn't allow students to used cell phone because the teachers says that students can find the information in books. Students says that by using cell phone is much easier to find information than in books.

Some teachers allow students to use cell phone during class so that students can find information easier. If students used books, some of the students can't even find the information that the students needed. for example, students that used cell phone is more likely to finish earlier than students that using books. in additions, Cell phone have more information than book. So, teachers should allow students to used cell phone during class for educational purposes.

Schools should allow the students to used cell phone in the class, so that students can work much faster and easier. If schools doesn't allow the students used phone in the class, some students going to have a hard time to work and students is going to take to much time on the assignment. Lots of students prefer cell phone because it much easier to find information. If students used books, students will take time to go back and forth and find the information that the students needed. Schools should allow the students to used cell phone in the class.

Technology is getting efficient and faster, so schools should let students used the technology so that students can get more information and can search any assignment that students need. Technology is adding new stuff every day, so that the students can learn something new every day. If students used the technology, students can get smarter and technology will improve every day. If students used books, students will never learn new things and students will have the same information. Schools should let the students use the technology so that the students will have more knowledge.

In conclusion, Teachers should not keep giving students books to study because students will never learn new thing in life. In addition, school should let students used technology in the classroom so that students will undertand technology and new information. Schools should improve the technology for the students, so that students can work faster. Technology will improve and students will get smarter, so that shools will provide technology for students.",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5
94EC7DF6EA74,"People these days dont go outdoors as much as they used to. I think that many people are avoiding going outside, because of cell phones. going outdoors is actually more fun than staying indoors doing nothing, because you can do a lot of activities. Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities.

People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. If you dont like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike. Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength.

Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength. A good time to go outdoors is when its sunny and when you have nothing to do. Also when your going outdoors make sure to bring someone with you so you can do activities with them. And if you have no one to do activities with head over to a local park to do activities with other people. Therefore i suggest that people, especially kids, to go outdoors more.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
BF0AF86DFDE1,"I agree with the plan of having an afterschool homework club. Because some students have a hard time finishing homework by themselves and if teachers stay with the students to help them finish their homework that would be amazing because that would mean less students failing. Also some kids might not have computers or any electronic device in their houses. Although if their is no afterschool homework club that may be good because students cant get help from any teachers and that could be good because they can know that not everything in life is easy unless you are good at it or try your best and your hardest. Another good reason that I think might be good for having afterschool homework clubs is that sudnets get a chance to enteract with other students and they also get a chance to veiw or examine how the other students do their own homework.

Some kids migh take advantage of having afterschool homework club by cheating the answers off of somebody and then leaving. So I think if the afterschool homework club shouldn't let students look at each others work until they are done. And some kids may take it as fun club and talk through the whole thing. But there is always the kids that do what they are supposed to do. They do not play around,joke around, and distract anyone from doing what they are supposed to do.

So, at the end I think that there should be an afterschool homework club because there is more details to back it up then there is for backing up not having the afterschool homework program. And alot of kids could change their work habbit and not get as much as bad grades. And mostly kids who care about their grades would want to join so there is high chance that kid do what they are supposed to do. But not having an afterschool homework program would mean that kids that really need to improve their grades would have a chance to do so and would have a chance to finish then grade they're in with good grades to start of for their next year.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Conserve energy and resources through this model could be a helpfully way for the school. It can be a support form for the community area. Following this model by extending the school day two hours can be method to conserve energy and resources.

First, conserve energy and resources through extend the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need those resources in the community. For example, in the community close to the school live some families with not much resources. They do not have money for pay the energy or buy needs as water or food. The only way that they can have resources as energy is through a big building as a school in the community. In other words, if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours can conserve energy and resources and give to the community as a needs. Thus, through follow the model by extending the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need it in the community.

Second, conserve energy and resources through the model by extending the school day two hours can be helpfully for the school in emergency situations.

Conversely, some people may claim that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not conserve energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources with this two more hours. However, it can be true, but to retake my point, following this model by extending the school day two hours would conserve energy and resources. It could be helpful for community needs and emergency situations in the school area. This conserve energy and resources could be a way to support the school and the community. Therefore, adopting the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully method to support the school area and the community.

FA0A22FE957A,"Summer vacation is for enjoyment. Every student is waiting for it. Students need long break to make his/her mind better. In vacation many students go for a trip with family or with friends. In school days students are waiting for vacation but when they have vacation they miss there school friends. Students need break for 4 to 5 weeks to enjoy there vacation.

Some educators students feel that the summer break is too long and they think when they return to school they cannot catch up easily. They said we have a holiday in year-round means only 1 times in a year. It should be only for 3 to 4 weeks as long as a winter break.

I did not agree with the educators students because students have aslo there life. Ther need to enjoy it make a fun and they also have dreams for their life. Educators students cannot decided others life. If they needs short break then they after 3 to 4 weeks they start study at home and fweel like they are doing their school works. Educators did not like long break because in schoolthey always study and at home also. Long break for educators student is like a death. Educators student cannot enjoy their vacation properly because they alway think about there study. I think in vacations all students cannot think about the study. They need to enjoy their vacation . Educators students also have their life and they need to enjoy it properly had a fun, spend time with with famil or friends. Go gor a long trip and refresh there mind. After all that they can start from begining for their study. They get better ideas for study. They study properly without tension.

I suggest educators students and normal students go togather because educators students also have an idea how to enjoy it make it fun and where they want to go. In summer vacation students may go beach, park, sunshine point and enjoy it. In summer vacation students may enjoy ever single movement because it can be there memories.

After then they finish there schools they can missed tht evey single movement that they had a lot of fun on it. They miss theirfiends whom they enjoy. They miss there school. But after their schools they cannot meetv their friends easily because all friends may go somewhere else for their study and for their best future.

So coclusion is every student enjoy the break. Do lot of fun with friends.

EC2758A5B74E,"Dear School board,

Why does a student's education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. It could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. What's also important to me is the learning experience. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. That's why I agree with the school board's plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldn't feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter.

To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldn't feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isn't a lot of time to learn once you start working. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isn't necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the student's work at our school without rushing them.

Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldn't have been possible because of the shortage of time. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. The issue is, we've never been able to finish, not because it wasn't possible to, but because there simply wasn't enough time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but it's also effective. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher.

Lastly, the school board's plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. Even though the students aren't at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which let's them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run.

In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldn't feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community. This is not an immense amount of change but it can be a big success, which is why I think you should really consider extending the school hours.

F1596AB60E72,"Do you think it is more beneficial to work in groups? Do you think working in groups makes you focus? Do you think working in groups is easy and fun?.

Do you think working in groups is more easier?. May people will say No and others will say yes to all these four question. working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. I think working in groups is more beneficial and good for many reasons because; we collaborate and share ideas, it more fun and easy working together and get a chance to work with people we really dont talk to. and we also get our project or work done on time.

Working in groups helps us by sharing ideas: i think working in groups is very important. it helps us bring our minds together to brainstorm some ideas or by sharing opinoin about the project or the assignment we are working on. we can discuss and make sure we understand and know the topic that we are working on. by doing this is a great thing because every person is contributing or participating in what we are working on.

Secondly, We get everything organized and get our things done on time: working alone somethings is very terrible because i takes a while to finsh, you dont get it done on time and sometimes you might need help from somebody, which sucks but working in groups more quicker. since there is about atleast three or four people in the group. it makes it more faster to get it done on time. it makes it even more easier to get the assignment done by contributing and aslo,

assigning or giving each and every person in the group a role to play or something to do to support the group in order to get it done on time.

Lastly, another reason why working in groups is beneficial is because it is easy and fun working together and let us get a chance to work with some people you really dont talk to in school. Most people likes dont like to socialize with people they dont know so they choose to work alone. which is okay,

but i think working as groups fun and easy. plus ,

it is very beneficial. I feel like working in groups is more fun. it makes us feel more free and more open to work together. when working with a group of people it is more fun because someone in the group may crack a joke or say something funny, it might cause a little bit of distraction but it brings laughter, smile, joy and happiness into our faces and that is what makes more fun and exciting to work together as a group.

In conlcusion, it is more beneficial working in groups than working alone. In groups we share ideas, we finish on time before due date and it is more fun and easy to work together with people but not just by yourself. because in groups we disscuss and make sure everyone in the group understand before we start putting effort in what we are about to do. it is very important to work together in groups because it tells us that we should encourage ourselves and work together as a team. And by showing a team work, hardwork , support and determination makes a group work more successful.            ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
6D104CA14B33,"75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college.

First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they don't have enough money, and parent's can't support him/her. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. Students won't need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud.

Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you won't have to worry about being alone.

Lastly, Some students don't turn in school work on time. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. Time management skills isn't only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. If you have all of that set, then you don't have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already.

I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you aren't mature enough, then you will struggle.

In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldn't have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves.

535D427F9FF9,"Yes, I agree with this statement because If you try your best to believe on yourself it will make impossible, like applying for you first job or anything that you wanna be for your career. specially you need it when you are going to college that will help you to save more money and you can get what ever you want. It will change your impression by how you get more skills like how to knowing yourself by finding jobs where you comfortable with. so that way when people wants to know you by personality they will know that first impression it has impossible to change because you have made yourself to make it and think that you can do it like other people do, then you will realize that you made a good experience. Not everyone has a same first impression because they had different personality and idea for their self, some of them is not changing of their impression the reason why is they do not trying them self what they believe that everyone has knowledge even if they can. The people who experiencing their impression that has already change their life, they are the one who having more self confident and they willing to sacrifices to spend time not for just wasting time.

Second , When students are in private with teachers the teachers will teach them new stuff. Finally , So they students can study for quiz and test and pass the quiz and test. There's more reasons but those are my reasons.

When you go to school you learn. The longer you stay the more you learn more . The more you learn the easier it is to get in collage . Collage looks at people who learn a lot so the after school program is gonna make them have a better future. Learn more and youll have a better career.

When you get tough new stuff it can be fun to learn about the new stuff your learning about . So when you learn new stuff you can be ahead of your class. Learning new stuff can make you twenty percent smarter than you usually are. Learning new stuff can get you a better job in the future.

There's always time to learn new stuff .

By going to a after school program you can study for quiz and test. If you get a good grade on mostly all your test then your gonna have good grades and thats a fact. quizzes are mini test so you should also try to pass them because both are huge deals. Passing test can bring your grade from a F to a C+. Passing quizzes can bring your grade from a F to a D+. So they bring you from a failing grade to a passing grade.

Its a really good idea knowing what you going to do with your life once you're done with high school. There are so many teens that once they are out high school they don't know what jobs they want to start and study for it. I think that thats why they should have many more classes that thats what its going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they gradute high school. for example classes that are for automotive technology is a confortable job in a way that you learn more about cars but in a way is dangerous at the same time because cars have so many heavy parts that could injured you. Another confortable job is being a lowyer lowyers don't do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you dont have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site. And thats the main idea that schools should offer carrer choices that involves students in a carreer class that will teach them once they are out school and that the jobs will interest the students. There is so many students that drop out school because is not interesting to them but thats a bad idea of not going to school because if a student doesn't graduate they will be workingfor some restaurant not earning that much money and working so many hours thats why it is important for teens to stay in school so that the school could offer them on what job they will choose once they graduate high school. School is one of the most important places where they will teach students what decisions they should take on their life once they are adults.

C652190DB53F,"Working alone is more beneficial than working with a group. People can work relax and calm without being interrupted, and no one has to ask other people opinion, and also people are shy , they might don't like being surrounded by other people. On the other hand, working with a group can be good, because everyone can share ideas. However working alone is much better.

Work is already stressful, and work with people talking and giving opinion about the job is worse. Imagine a work where the whole group is speaking and there is someone stressed, this person won't be able to work relax and think about new ideas, probably when the person get home, it will be more stressed than someone who worked alone and quiet. Being alone make any person relax, and once you're relax no one can stop it, the ideas come to your mind.

During doing the work, might suddenly appear a new brilliant idea, and with a group the proposal is check with them and see if everyone agrees, and it spend time, and also might happen that not everyone agreed. Working alone can gain time, because people can use the time they're asking the group to work more instead of asking someone opinion. Also it creates discussion, more and more people speaking at the same time, disagreements and agreements, wasting time, and making people confused. Then it is better work alone to gain time working instead of asking, everyone does your own work.

Being surrounded by a lot of people might be hard for shy people. For example, I'm shy, and work in group for me is a struggle, have to talk to other person, have to share my ideas, I can't do my work relax, I can't either think about anything. The impression caused is that people will look at your work and judge it, and won't agree, and there I'm, needing to do everything again, in most of the times I don't even show my own work I just agree with other people work. It is not good, the brain doesn't work how it was supposed to work, people looking and may judging, all of it might collaborate for a terrible work.

Some people might say that work together people could share ideas and open the door to new opportunities, of course share ideas is a good point, see every point of view. However working alone has much more benefits, is better to have a good time working, without stress than share ideas and get home stressed and full of everything.

Working alone in a peaceful place, just you and your thoughts, to think about everything, every point, to analyze all things, relax and calm, whitout being shy or stressed. It is the benefts that everyone needs to have.                   ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

A lot of student have troubling time to find what career they want to have many student career doesn't end so well, once they enter high school student can find what career to have in the future, student can even visit a website to see what career are intresting for them or can visit careers search in school..

If i have to choose a career at a young age i would not think of anything because i haven't find what career i'm intresting in also, it'll be better i enter high school and find what career i like and enjoy because thinking of what career i want would be hard at a young age also, i can talk to a teacher about career in high school so they can help me of what career are available that are right for me and i don't think student should find a career at a young age it would be hard for them to find one.

I have to disagree of student finding a career at a young age because if student do find a career at a young age then they won't be forcusing in school work they mind will be them having that career by now and will brag about it to there friends and teacher no one want to hear thats also, it may not be the right career for them they need time to think the right career they want to enjoy in life.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5
4E91C3BA11D0,"Imagine being a new sixth grade student in middle school and, not knowing the expectations nor, knowing anything about the place you are around. Elementary students should need to know what will go on in middle school and it's expectations. So explaining it will make it easier for sixth grade students.

once coming to middle school

First of all, students should know about the class room expectations. Middle school student should be respectful, responsible, and productive. Kids should know better than to play around ,or ignore teachers and ignore their work. Students should come to school ready to learn not to play around. Kids should be quiet while a teacher is talking and should also be silent while taking a test or quiz. They shouldn't be throwing stuff around the room or be yelling or screaming. When i used to talk i would get in trouble but, i would always listen to the teacher.

Second of all, students should know about halls and lockers expectations. While walking in the halls kids should be safe. Students should not run in the halls and, should not push and shove other kids. Because students could get injured. At your lockers you should get your things for the next class and not talk to your friends in the hallways. If you cant open you locker ask a teacher near by. But you shouldn't kick your locker. If i couldn't get my locker open i would just ask a teacher to help me. Don't kick or slam you locker respect the schools things because it provides you with the things you need to learn with.

Last but not least, you must know the lunch expectations. During in line to get your lunch you shouldn't be touching everything nor, keep a hold up in the line. Be productive and get your lunch fast then take a seat at you table. If you need anything raise your hand dont get up with out permission. Don't throw food at people pick up your trash once you leave and, dont make a mess. While eating you should stay in you own seat and not at others tables. Once i would go to lunch i would get my food fast then take a seat with my friends at my table. In the cafeteria it is super loud so try not to scream or yell because it will be extra louder if you do.

In conclusion this is why teaching kids about middle school is a good lesson to teach elementary school students. So that once they go to middle school they would be ready. The students would already know most of the school expectations and how things work around.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

I had to come to the United States and I never learned nothing about car so now that i'm big I'll love to learn more about car and how to be an mechanic.

To be honest I remember telling my dad that one day I was going to be the greatest mechanic of all the time because I wanted him to saw that I could do it and make him feel proud I remember him smiling and telling me that

I could became whatever I wanted to be in this world I just had to worked for it and don't stop until I reached my goal, the only memories I have with my dad are me working with him, we did not spend too much time together I only saw him when he was at work and some weekends because he did not leaved together but now that I'm big and I can make my own decisions and have the opportunity to be anything in this country I want to be an mechanic and make my dad proud.

D6278021E119,"I agree with this way to learn and study. I think that is a good idea for many students that can't coming to the school or have a work.

One of the benefits is that the students can wake up late, because the class is online so, you can take the class in the afternoon, you can stay in your home relax in the bed also if you want eate you can do.

Some guys work in the morning, in the night or all the day.

I have a friend that he work of

8am to 5pm and he always is tired and this can help his, for the future.

He can study in the night and have his class with tranquillity.

Some people think that this a way to lose the time, but I do't think so.

Because I believe that you can be a profesional person if you want.

My friend don,t wanna work in a restauran all the time, he want to be a mechanic and if he take class online his dream can be convert a reality.

67D58F9FA53C,"I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council. The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game that's how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other

.And students council i don't now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life. Okay this off the topic that we are talking about okay, all most every billoner drop of of school and collage to start what they wanted to do and what there dream was the did not stop it they all went for it

Okay now this is back on the topic. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some don't have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and don't have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said. And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english .

Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .

So what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

He or her can follow their own instincts or idea. Everyone should make own choice or own decisions in their life. Their life is so important to them that they could make own decisions without people tell what to do or ruin their life. People should be wrong about their life not other people life. If they want to help they should talk with the people if want help or not. I know everyone want to help out but sometime they don't want help for other people,friends or their family. They could solve their problem at there own.

For example we don't need people to tell other people how to live their life. They can make their decisions. They a lot people that make bad decision or good decisions in their life. It good that they did bad choice because they real what they did and they won't do it again in their life. People can live their life but they have to make good choice their life not bad choice. They should have good friends that make good decision in their that always help them in their life. If you have a friend that make bad decision sometime at friends won't help you out. Then you are on your own with you're problem. Sometime good to hang out with friends but you have to make good choice if you're going to hang out with your friend's.

I know people can make own decision and can help other people to not make bad choice in life. Is good you got friends and family that have your back when you want to make own decisions in your own life. Sometime family don't agree with your choice or decision you want to make. You're life is important you should make good choice in you're life to happy or live your life with you're family's and friends. You don't have to wrong about other people opinion. Sometime good to listing to other people opinion if it will help you understand your problem or to make good decision or not. Some people don't want help for other people. They don't want other people to be wrong about their life or be noise. The only who makes decision are the adults or the teenager but not the kid's.

We can achieve many goals by making things work the way we want it. And we do accomplish more when we are always doing the things we have to get done. It helps you a better person.

We can do it even if they let you down telling you, you can not do it.

9B5E878ED861,"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.

Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.

I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.

In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.

According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.      ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

I disagree with this statement all students need four years in high school for know what to do in the future and they do not have any problem in college

Students graduate in three years is not good because in four years you can learn more about that career you prefer to be in the future, you can take more opportunities for to be successful people think that is good because you can graduate one year early but some times is much better continues in high school for prepare yourself. in four years you take more classes and learning about it. For example student wants to graduate and wants to be a mechanic he needs to keep going in high school for four years he learn about that career he wants and another subjects.

Some people they do not like the idea for to graduate early because they do not think that is prepare for to go to college. College is a serious thing so all people need to prepare for to go there ,when you go to the college you have a idea that difficult be for you but not impossible . you need to pass all your classes in college but for that you need to study and try your best in high school that is the way for a good student .

Some people prefer graduate one year early , they has reasons, they wants to finish the career for to help the family or some people just finish the high school and go to work. is probably is the bigger reason why some people choose that opinion. for me both reason is good because you need to stay in school for to be successful and understand why some persons wants to graduate early they wants to help his/her family so both options that is very good.

Four years in high school is the bets option can you choose because you learn more, study more, and prepare more , for me that is the good way for to successful in life. Probably be more hard but you can do it, you need to try the best do yo have for in the future you will be a good person with a good job and can help your family. when help your family you are a good person and recognize that job was your parents did for you so keep going and do it a 4 years in high school this is good for success in life .",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0
CC8C5C963660,"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.

One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.

Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.

Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.

Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.            ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

The schools in the country spend millions and millions of dollars every year on fast food. Some fast food are really expensive, moreover some schools would like to earn more money and spend that money on education. in fact, that is a good chance to start earning money.

Some students with overweight have problems in school, like having bad grades and bulling . By changing the schools menu will allow the students to loose weight in fact salads, fruits, and vegetables would permit students to loose weight and also it will let then to be in a good shape. To be in a good shape would allow you to get good grades in classes as PE. Some students have bulling problems for overweight, by having a good shape would let them to stop it.

In conclusion changing the schools menu would be a good idea because the students will get healthier food, the schools will have an extra chance to expend less money and give a better education for students, and having a good shape would improve student's grades and will stop other issues on their daily lives.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5
14EE006078C4,"Some student can learn to attend classes from home. And I think it's a great way to learn if you want some good grades. If I wanted to learned; I would stayed at school or watch a video to how to English, biology, or what classes do I chose from. But online or video conferencing are very different. online can be probably a website, YouTube, (Example like be able watch how to do math) or other. video conferencing is probably like a chat room or some video live.

Online is a great way to learn because I use on homework, essay, Google, YouTube, and other website. And here an of example. If I wanted how make a cake and when I used online website. It bring the website how to bake a cake. And there simple as that. But sometime if I ever get like a hard assignment and I checked it online, and it gave me the wrong answer, then sometimes the website can't be everything right. But I go ahead and tried other website to see if there a correct answered.

Now let say that I had to studied a lion. I can go online to checked in Google and it bring me to whole bunch of website, and click one of those website to see if there a way to studied some lion or go to YubeTube to watch how scientist studied theses creatures.

Video conference is probably like talking to a teacher or maybe live chat. And the way I think of the video conferencing is not to bad. It like you're teacher or someone is teaching you, and its like simpler to school. If I wanted to do it, like if there a problem that I need to fix then I go to video conference so they can helped me and the question. But I think its a great idea to do it.

The way I see is online is a helpful and video conference is helpful too. But I think it like home school staying at home and studied online or video conference. So my reasons is it a way to learned fast, getting good grades, or other information that you need for the future. And here a other reason why to use online or video conference. Online is been update like a few times. For example lets say Google doc. Google doc has been one the greatest website that I ever used. In that website, you can do almost everything like book project, essay, making slide shows and other helpful tools. But video conference is pretty helpful too. And my example is like if I need help I can contact my fellow people to help me.

Finally the best way to learned is sometimes online for helpful website and video conference to contact if teacher or other can help me. But I likely used online because it pretty helpful because let say I forgot a textbook and my homework is due the next day. Well I can go online and check my answer if i got it right. And I sometime I always used online to see if how to bake a cake or other information that I need.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0
C4A874260D21,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and when they return in the fall, they become more lazy and they can't retain information as easily when they were in school.

Summer break is the only long break that the school gave to the students to do all the things that they couldn't do during the school year and they can rest for a long preiod. I don't agree for these reasons:

First, A lot of students wants to work during the school year or do other things that take more time to do, but they can't do it because they got too much homework or they need to study for a tests that they have that week and they just had time for that. So in Summer break they got 3 months so they can work and do more things that they couldn't do during the school year. Students can work and have more experiences that can help them when they want to apply for another work that is much better for them and learn more things.

Next, Students needs a break after the school year. Most of the students get stressed for all the works and tests the teachers gave to them, their brains needs to relax and rest for a preiod time because it's not good to be always working, they got tired too. So Summer break is the best period to relax and distract for a period time. Students can go to the beach and have fun, Enjoy more time with their famillys, hang out with their friends, go visit new places, too much things they can do in this break and the weather is perfect too.

Finally, In Summer break the students don't worry about works or tests they may have need to present when the break is end. When they have Fall, Winter or Spring break the school gave to them just one week and in that week most of the teachers gave to the students works and tests they need to make after the week breaks, so in conclusion they don't have breaks because they need to study or do works that the school gave to the students. In Summer they don't need to worry about that and enjoy the time they got.

Some persons may don't agree with me because they think that have more breaks during the school year is better for students, but they need to know that the students got works during that breaks and they need to study for tests that they need to make after the week break, so in summary, they don't got that time to relax and give a time period to their brains so they can rest.

In conclusion, Summer break is the only long period that the students got to relax and they can do so many things that they couldn't do during the school year because of all the works they got and test that they need to study for. So Summer break needs to stay like that and is the best season for students so they can enjoy and have fun in their long break.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
4E22E3143561,"Agree, living in a world where you sometimes has to be someone else to fit in the society or with friends it doesn't makes us feel confident it is not the best feeling, because we are pretending to be someone else not who we are. And when we do that, the only one who will get hurt is us, if we are and behave exactly as we are may be there won't be too much people around us but that is not the most important accomplish, the most important accomplish is when we learn how to love our self and be who we are no matter if there won't be a lot of people surround us, if someone will loves me it has to love me for who I am not for who I pretended to be.

Everyone in this world deserve to be love for who they are, no one needs to be someone else to be love or accepted , we have to stop trying to be someone else just to fit with a group of people because if you're not like them, then that's means that you don't belong to that place. Been who we are is what makes us special, there are no specifics forms that forces you how to be, pretending it won't make you happy. Just will make you feel that you don't deserve to be love, it will make feel desolate, it will make you feel that you are not funny as the rest of your friends. But when we learn how to be our self in this world where it constantly triying to make us feel or be someone else it is the greatest accomplishment, because when we know how love our self for who we are and how we look then we will be capable to love someone else for who they are not for who they pretend to be.

Feeling like you don't deserve to be in this world is not the best feeling sometimes all you wanted to do is just go to a place where nobody knows you, where you want to start over again and do what you really love, be who you are and if someone gets to knows you it will accept you the way you are but something that we can't see is that we don't actually needs to go to the other side of the world to start over because we can try to start with our self, we have to start loving us the way we are. Why do you think that sometimes we feel desolate too? Do you think that is because we are been honest we our self? It is important to ask our self that question because it makes us think about our self for a minute and forget about the rest of the people about what they would think of me, most of the time we forgot about our owns feeling about how we gonna feel at the end if we do or behave the way that the society is asking us to do. And when we forget about our self that is the time when we feel desolate, and what can fill that what we think is missing? Is learn how to be our selves. If you're not funny as they want you to be or they might say that you have to be like the rest, that's not right because you will make yourself to a side and you will start been someone who's not you, someone you don't love but you have to be that way so you can be accepted and when that happen you are losing the greatest thing you have inside of you to give... Been who we are maybe it won't makes us see the perfect person in the world but it will make you happy to know that you have accomplish the greatest goal! Which is to be yourself in a world that always wants you to be someone else. Now that I had learn how to love myself I'm able to see that everyone deserve a change to be themselves, to show what they have, learn how to be you it also help you to see the beauty in the rest of the people that is surround you it also makes you free to stop thinking that they need certain things to be love or accept.

I think it's a positive effect on peoeple's lives. It can make there lives way more easier. Someone may not like going anywhere to check out books and shop so they prefer to order them online.

Technology helps a lot of people in their lives, an example can be someone that doesn't wants to attend public school so they prefer taking online classes. Online classes are helpful for students because they may have jobs to go to and they don't have time to attend so they can take online courses. Not just students but also teachers, instead of grading papers they can grade them online if they want to. Technology helps a lot of students with school and teachers with grading and other stuff.

Technology can help people lives in other ways, someone that doesn't like to go shopping can order them through online without speaking to anybody. Maybe they don't have time to go to the store and don't have transportation to get there. Technology can not just help you to order stuff but it can help you find an item that you don't know where it is without speaking to another person. There are many stores that you can check out by yourselves instead of waiting in line for another person that can ring you up. Technology helps a lot of people's lives in shopping.

So yes, I think technology has a positive effect on people's lives. It helps them in a lot of ways. Not just ordering stuff online but also physically.

They need to know what they want to do when they grow up. Their course of study in high school will help them to choose what career they think they suppose to do. They have to focus to what career they choose and they gonna fathom out that career .Example ,when a student want to be a doctor when he grow up that's why he have to focus to learn well biology and all about the doctor's job. If we don't show them what they need to do or like to do , they gonna lost outside the world . They don't know what career they need to follow and they are not going to have a good job. We gonna ruin their life indirectly. So that we should teach them about career and guide they to the right way .

65975436BE5C,"True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.",4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0
CB71E5F9AE1E,"Do you think failure is a good thing or bad thing? Well, what a British prime minster ones said""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Some people may think this is bad thinking because of how hard you try,but you have no success at the end. Yes,i agree with the statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because of these three reasons,failure makes me better than i was at first,never giving up without motivation ,and be able to over come that obstacle that i work so hard for. My first reason, of why failure is a good thing because it makes every body better at what they started with. For example, when i first started learning how to ride a long board i was very afraid that i would fall and hurt myself. At first i really terrible and failed over and over again. Until one day my friend came over my house and showed him how i would do it. But once again i fell off my long board crazy like. Then my friend started to laugh but in a funny way,so i also stared to laugh too. I ask him why he laugh at me,he told me"" i remember at was like you when i stared to learned long board"". He also told me he was really proud of me not giving up and failing. what i understood of what he was trying to tell me is that failure can make me better from having that kind of enthusiasm in my spirit. related back to my first reason is that not just giving up,but having a motivation every time i do anything to keep going. In order to have that kind of motivation of getting out of bed and doing what you want to accomplish at the end of the day is looking up to someone who helps you get to work or hustle i can say. For example, famous people who did or was successful in life like Bill gates who found the gold rush,Arnold the best body builder of all times,and Stan lee who invited the marvel universe. All these people was in our shoes before they became famous. They can motivate us by what people probably said to them like ""no"" or ""it can not be done"". They did not listen to adorers Sayers would though that never would happen. My final reason of why failure is a good thing is to over come any obstacle that can get in your way. For example, the time when i was fifteen years old i had a problem with one of my classes in school where i had to learn to stay away from people who were not good influence on me. At first they looked like good people,but when i started to notice that they were hiding something from me i was really currouse what was it about. Until one day i was with my best friend in his room just chilling and later on he showed me on his phone what i never though they would do. I was really dissapionted what they were doing beyond my back. So on that day i had to over come my obstacle of not making friends with anybody who looks nice or their appraise. In conclusion i do agree with the British prime mister Winston Churchill quote that says ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". because of these three reasons failure makes every body better,never giving up without motivation,and lastly over coming any obstacle that can be on road to success. something that i always believed in is ""no pain,no gain"".

FEC7696871E4,"Scientist Albert Einstein said,"" Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I really agree with him. Imagination can make yourself happier, can help people, it also can find a nice job that you want. What are these things mean? Let me tell you in this essay.

First, imagination can make yourself happier. Why? It is because you can imagine something that you like. For example, you want to fly like a bird but you can't do that. You can imagine how that feel. It feels free? Comfortable? Or tired? You can also imagine how you look like when you were 100 years old. Imagination make yourself happy.

Second, how can imagination help people? Let's think about if there is a child crying in the mall and everyone look at her because she dress so weird. You can use your imagination at this moment. You may told her to imagine with you. For example,""Don't crying sweetie, think about everyone look at you is because you dress like a princess. Now you are visiting them. You have to be nice and elegant. "" Maybe she will stop crying.

Lastly,parents always said "" You can't find a nice job that you want by having your imagination."" I think you can find a job with your imagination. For example, if you want to be a home designer but you don't have imagination. You make the house so horrible. You will got fired and you can't earn money. On the other hand, if you want to be writer and you can imagine lots of things and create 30 or more excellent books. You can earn lot of money even earn more that a doctor. So, I think Imagination can find a really nice job that you want.

To sum up, I totally agree with Scientist Albert Einstein. "" Imagination is more important than knowledge. Imagination can make yourself happier, can help people, or find a nice job that you want. I think it imagination is the most important thing in the world!        ",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
A754F3AC48E3,"I'm agree to take guides about careers because, I think that the students include to me, we want to have a spacific career guide when, we enter to high school because when we will go to collage, we have to be prepared with ideas, how is the career that we want to take and the students has to be ready with knowlegde with his own careers.

The first reason, I say that because the students will be more excite to came to the school, they will say, I like to go to shool beacuse, I practice somenthing that I love. I think that the schools need to change to give the student to choose, what they want know, I not talking about the classes, I talking about careers guides. I know we have young age but we want to be something our life, we have the goals to work in something, we love. The school's need give the opportunity to prepare the students. If the school's have guide careers or activities of work the students, they will enjoy that.

The seconds reasons is personal but, I see that almost the all people of my country when they come here and they have the opportunity to study but, when they end from the high school they stay in the same thing working in not good jobs earning 14 dollars per hours and some people say now that the diploma from high school is nothing to their. Some people go to school beacuse it's something ilegal, if they not going, I think they will put more interest to the study if they have the opportunity to study what they want to be when they are more olders. This are examples from others people too.

The students dreams that the school have something similar from college.

Some people tell me that when I end from high school, I will work in the same jobs, maybe I think the same because my family don't have the money but if the school's have something of academic's to know about the jobs, maybe the academic is not free but, is more cheeper than college or the school's have something that we can know about the jobs. Maybe the all student is not rich's but the only thing they want is work what they want.

student should have time to go home and do their work, they should have time to study, Also they should have time to do their homework. If student know that they have homework to do he have to do it on time.

However they start failing the classes, they start failing by not turning their work on time, if they do turn in their work on time their grades will drop. They should start paying attention and turn in their work on time. some student also sleep in class, Being to tired may be the case, if student stay up late and doing their work they can't get up on time for school they will get sleep in class and they can't do their work on time.

Because of not having time to work, failing, and sleeping in class, school should decide. Student don't have enough time to study. Student grades start going down and then they will fail the class, school should decide what student should do to pass the class doing their work on time, and not sleeping on class.

I think that this quote explains that you are able to choose it by yourself. I disagree and I believe that other humans make our character traits.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
B2AD2177A42C,"People can form their own character based on what they choose to make it. A person is given the responsibility of choosing whether to do the good or bad thing. For example, if a person hears that their friend is in a bad situation and then choosing to help them out, they are showing that they are capable of make their own character. Others may say that people do not get to choose their own character because it is beyond their control. However, people can determine their own character based on how they want it to be because they know what steps they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for them, and they know what they want to become in the future.

Knowing what steps to take will help the person make the right choice in defining their character. People tend to ask to other if the choices that they are making is the right one, but instead of asking others what they think the person has to be confidence in themselves that they are making the right choice. For instance, if a student wants a good future they have to work hard and study in order to accomplish it, and not choose to go the wrong way. On the other hand people may say that having a second opinion is a good thing, but that is wrong because it may cause them to doubt themselves. This is why people should first plan their transaction then take action on it.

People have the free well to choose what they want to be and what is best for them. A person knows what their interest are, so they choose according to what they like to do the most. Furthermore, if a person finds a job that they really like and want to get it, they will work hard for it. Some may disagree with this because others may see that what they are choosing to do is not the best thing for them. This is why people need to think about their choices before doing anything.

People can choose their own character and what they want to become in the future. People could choose to became; artists, actors, singers, or doctors because they have dreamed of becoming one of these seen they were a child. For instance, they would have to focus and work hard in order to achieve their future selves. However, others may say that it is impossible to become what you dreamed to be in the future because they will face may opsticals in their lives. On the other hand, if a person really wanted to become that person they will work intensively for it.

A persons character can be constructed by how they choose make it because they know the course that they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for themselves, and they know what they want to be in the future. For example, If a person wants something badly, they will work persistently for it. Another example is that, the person will prove to everyone that they are capable of achieving their dream, and that it is possible to get. People should choose to make their own character because they will be comfortable with their choices.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

71F27422C5FC,"My friend, Generic_Name, is a very good student, he will not go to bed unless he finishes his homework. However, because the school has changed the system from five-day school week to four-day school week, he had to do more works than usual. He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. His parent decided to move him to another school. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend.

To start with, students do not have time to do more works. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time.

To continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier.

Some people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule.

And the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care.

In conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week? Please write a letter to the local government of the city to change the schedule of our school. We are not using resources to waste, we are using resources to make a key to open the ""Success Gate"" leads to the bright future for our generation and the next America's generations.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
FB70FE5B31A8,"Generic_Name moved from military academy to a public school whehn he was 14, he was a serious person, and he was really respectful. Four years later, I met him at a restaurant and he was a whole new person, he dressed different and his personality was different, Generic_Name's influences in public schools changed him.

People's character traits are formed by influnces beyond our control because the enviroment that we live in takes a huge part on how we are, who we are, and how we act, and because of people like our parents that have guided us and influenced us throughout our whole lives, and while some people say that a person is able to choos who they are or control their character traits, the majority of the people in society live by other people's influences.

The enviroment that a person lives in takes a huge part on someone's character because; their culture, their religion, and the people they surroud themelves with, always have an impact on someone's traits; for example, a private christian school student might not have the the character traits as a public school student because the enviroments are way different. In conclusion people's traits are controled by influces beyond our control because people is always getting influenced on the daily regardless of what envioment they're in.

People like our parents are responsable for most of the character traits we have since they have been with us our whole life. They guide us everyday, and they teach us what is right and what is wrong. Most of the kids in this world look up to their parents or use them as a role model, and that controls a huge part of our character traits. In conclusion our traits are formed by incluences out of our control because our parents, who have been with us our whole life impact us every day with thei lessons.

Some people say that a person is able to control their character traits or choose who they are, because they are alone and they probably don't like talking to people or learning from people so; therefore they don't get influenced by anyone , so they start forming their character and they start being who they are base on only what they do.

Most of the people in this world are influenced by the outside since most poeple go to work everyday, go to school everyday, and talk to people everyday, thay are always getting something out of someone, it could be an advice or a lesson. I don't think many people are able to control their character traits on these days with social media, and things like that going on.

In concluison our character traits are controled by influences we can't control because the enviroment with live in always has an impact on us, the people we surround ourselves with have an impact on us and society in general has an impact on us. Moving forward i think it would be good for people to keep being influnced by the outside because we will get to know how everything works, and no matter who we are influenced by there will always be someone that will tell is if it's right or wrong.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
07F3241EB3C6,""" How would pairing older students with younger students in school be helpful for both older and younger students?""

When I was in elementary school in Zambia I skipped 4th grade and went in 5th grade and it was challenging for me to keep up with the work in 5th grade. I was used to doing the same work as the other 4th graders in my school however things changed when I skipped 4th grade to 5th grade. When I got in 5th grade I started doing harder work than I did in 4th grade, I started getting lower grades than I did in 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade (where there were older people than me) I had to work hard to be at the same level as the other 5th graders. This was like taking college classes in high school. Pairing older students with younger students in school will help both the older and younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning and become good examples when they grow up.

When younger students are paired with older students, the younger students will be able to learn from the older students. Generally speaking kids are most likely to follow what older people are doing. In this case if older students are paired with younger students the younger students will learn good manners from the older students. Younger students will learn many things from the older students such as: good behavior, hard work, kindness, and etc... When I'm sitting around elder at home I learn a lot about different countries and cultures in the world. For instance, when the elders are talking about what is happening in Congo - a country in Africa - I learn about the economy in Congo and its government. It is just like learning in my Civics class at school. This is beneficial for me because I get learn and share about is going in some other places with my Civics teacher.

When older students are paired with younger student, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students. Being a good example for younger kids is best for what the will do and be in the future hence, it is why my parents tell me to be the good example for my younger my younger brothers by being well behaved and respectful so that my younger bothers will learn from my behavior. My AVID teacher told me that when his son was young he taught him that boots were bananas and bananas were boots therefor his son knew that boot were bananas and bananas were boots. According to what AVID teacher told me in the pasted sentence it shows that kids do what elders do. It is really important for older people to be good examples for the younger ones.

When older students are paired with younger students, the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learn in school and become good examples when they grow up. Additionally when older students are paired with younger students it will encourage the your students to work hard and on the same level as the older students. I have a friend who skipped 7th grade at my school. When I asked her how she was doing in 8th grade, she said at first it was really hard for her to maintain her grades. But she encouraged herself to work hard and get good grades. She had to study every night and on the other hand she had work to do at home. It became challenging for her to keep up with both school work and work she did at home. Ultimately from all her hard work she got a scholarship for college while in middle school.

Pairing older kids with younger kids in school is helpful for both the older students and the younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning in school and become good examples for others when they grow up. How would your life be like being in a place where there are no elderly people to learn from? We should always be good examples for younger people so that they can learn from us.

C41DFE052637,"Imagine someone is doing the same skill that he already has mastered, he is going to stay in the same place. He will never grow. One reason why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Is the best to try to do new things than staying in the same place and never growing.

First reason, why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Being stronger in other things can really put you to the top where you never thought you could be at. When getting stronger at other things it could make someone the best athletic person or the best person that is strong in so many things. When being strong or good at things, you can even help your friends if they are struggling. Once you become a strong person are you going to be able to do anything.

Next, being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Learning new skills can help someone out a lot. When doing a lot of new things it can make someone a healthier person. Someone is going to start realizing their improvement and once they start seeing results, they are going to start getting motivated even more.

Finally, someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Finding things that someone never knew they could do will make someone pretty shocked. When someone finds out more things that they are able to do, it can help them join in more activities. The people that can do more, they have a better advantage because they can do more that others can't do. Its pretty shocking that there are people that don't know that they could do something that they never thought they could do.

In conclusion, someone can make themselves even stronger than what they are now. When learning new skills it can make your ability improve. Also, someone can even find out new sports or skills that they never thought they could do. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5
C02F3803D0D1,"People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know whats gonna happen.

Impressions is like when you thought somethings, its just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. you think that she's not telling you the truth but you don't know the truth.

Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the Iphone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different.

When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is gonna be. For example: When my mom got pregnant and she had me, her impression was that it was gonna be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here i am, 18 years old, a big boy and she was impress and sad, but when she see that i was very handsome her impression change she's happy now.

Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say.

Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something.

I hope you never impress by something or someone, that can be different that you thought, thats why we dont judge, God is the only one who can judge.",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. ""

Opening a door.

Giving compliments.

Helping someone with bag's.

asking about their day.

Impact on other people:

The impact on other people can be so important that even can save lives! and example of that can be that if you notice someone that is passing trough bad moments but you doun't know how to help the simple act of kindness of asking ""how is your day?"" can actually help that person by knowing that someone cares about him/her. Other ways that the small act's of kindness can change things is by making a person do good things for others. For example, if you help someone with bags, they will see how that little help makes them feel, that will make them do it for someone else or even back to you.

2CD73298526F,"The use of technology has had a negative effect on people's lives, because they tempt to take the use of technology as a fundumental part of their life. They get so attached that they miss beautiful moments, people or opportunities, life is full of extraordinary places and people to share life with but why make all that dissapear just to be on a phone or any other technological device.

Technology can be consider a threat for families. Why would it be consider a threat? Well, let's say you and your family are going to Generic_City, you go to the best hotel an as soon as you get there your wife, your children or even you go on their phones immediately without wanting to do or go anywhere. There could also be another example with that, a family reserves a table on the best expensive restaurant in Generic_City and as soon as the family sits down they all go on their phones, even the parents gave that example instead of them wanting to have a nice family dinner. Families lose the connection due to cell phones because just like that family had a date with their phones and not with their own family the connection starts to decrease and after all that it'll be hard to have that open conncetion with your family. That's consider a threat because you're letting the use of technology define how your family will be or do things in there lives. It could also be a positive effect because and not all families struggle with the addiction to technology, people such as; doctors, judges, lawyers, businessman, etc... They have a job and the best way to keep in contact with people that need of them, they have to always be using their cell phones or computers to be in touch with them no matter where or what they are doing. But that shouldn't be any excuse not to have a family time, family comes over everything, you can't miss moments with your family or else you'll regret it in the future you'll just remember being on the phone that entire time. Don't let technology control you or your family.

Love could also vanish do to the lack of commitment with your phone. Relationships now a days are very different from back then, they don't get to be more romantic well they could but maybe through texting. The love they had for each other could easily be broken do to social media, either the guy or the girl could possibly find someone else and cheating happenes, I know that does not the whole reason why but it does affect you in a way. Let's talk about Khloe Kardashian, she being a famous women had to receive the bad news of her baby dad cheating on her moments before she gave birth. In some cases couples don't get to enjoy their date because one of them is in there phone. I've seen that breaking up through text is the biggest excuse for a men or woman, if social media didn't work like it does now there woulndn't be a lot of cheatings. Social media could also be used for good, if you are in a long distance relationship you have the opportunity to talk to your significant other across the world and also because you get to know someone you might marry in the future. But is still bad, social media causes a lot of things to happen such as suicide or having eating disorders or even bulling.

Technology has a negative effect on most kids in elementary, middle or high school. Back then you woulnd't see little kids having the latest phone, because the new generation that is coming is more open minded about how ""society"" works. There might be things I don't even know and yet you ask a seven year old kid and they know it already, Society has changed a lot from when I was a little girl to how kids are now. KIds are mostly connected on their phone most of them just want to stay home and play Fortnite, not only kids play that all grown ups which makes them looks so childish in my opinion, while before they would really want to go outside to play any sports they could. Little kids having phones at there early age makes them have bad grades in school because there main focus is texting, videos, or video games which don't take them anywhere. The percentage of students having good grades has decreease in a way that surprises you. how many times you see little babies asking for their paretns phone and what do parents do, they give them there phone because they can't control their children what will make them obey is technology. In some way it could be good because they get the chance to have more opportunities in school wise, like having computers in our home helps get your grade up if you use it wisely, some parents don't have the money to buy their kid a computer while schools does provide some don't take a good opportunity. Just look at how children are attached to there phones. Focusing in school will give you so much opportunities that will take you on a greater point in your life and I feel like that is what we need to make all of them understand.

In conclusion, Is good to have technology but don't use it to hurt people which will take them to commit suicide or having eating disorders. Cherish every moment you get to have with your loved ones don't let technology control who you are or who you can be. People don't have the same human contact anymore because they are more worried that they'll get a text that they need to respond as soon as possible. Live every moment to the fullest you never kknow what could happen in ten minutes or the next day.      ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
FDE0B653AD74,"When you play activities or an instrument, don't you get a relief when you play them?

I like to play volleyball, because I can make new friends, it gives me an opportunity in life to have a good life, and it is really fun to hit the ball when it flies really close to you.

My first reason is that I can make new friends. Having friends is an amazing thing, because you can always rely on your friend and have some kind of connection to them. Friends will help you at any time, whether it is hard times, bad grades, fight with someone, arguments and others. Friends are always there for you and it does not need to be a daily conversation with them to be friends. If you have friends, you will have more success in your life and it will give you new opportunities in life, such as, jobs and etc. When you become friends with someone, you become a different person and everyone around you are happy and you also can make a difference in the world if you have more opportunities to have a great life.

My second reason is that the games give me more opportunities to participate in any activities that I am interested in. Doing activities is good, because it keeps you healthy and a more enjoyable person. When you play sports it teaches you math, because the ball is circular and it has a circumference, radius, and a diameter. People don't just play sports, they play sports, because they enjoy them and when you play it, it feels like that you are free and able to do anything in the world. When you believe you can do it, you will be able to do it, you just don't need to give up if something goes wrong.

My third reason is that it is fun to hit the ball when it flies towards you. It is fun, because it give you new experiences and different feelings that you have never had felt before. But to play a sport you have to have good grades and a good spirit of wanting to play the game. Sports are like your new life, because when you start playing, you cannot stop. It feels like you are addicted to the game and that it is so fun that you cannot stop playing it. When you are in a team, it gives a different feeling, because you have to work hard to get into the team. You don't just go and play a sport, it has to include how hard enough you have worked to play in that sport.

My fourth reason is that you should never give up on any sport, if you already started it. Sports also give a different point of view of people. Having feelings is a really good experience, because it shows a whole different part of our personality. Sports give you a life experience that you will never forget, even if you are old. And, whenever you feel along you can go talk to your teammates about it and they will help you out with it. Teammates are the best part of the game, because they open so many new doors to you and you just have to work hard enough that you can go through the doors that you chose to live with.

My final reason is that even perfect people make mistakes in games. If you want to be perfect in a game, you just have to practice a lot to become better and better at it. Practicing show your teammates that you care about them and the game. New friends always pop out from different angles in your life. Life without friends would be miserable, because you have nobody to help you in anything.

Playing volleyball is really important to me , because I can make new friends it is really fun to hit the ball when it comes towards you, and give opportunities for a new and better life.

In conclusion, sports are really fun, because you can always gain courage in the game. You can experience things you never experienced before. It can make you want to become a coach, because if you are a coach it will be fun to give kids what they want to play and get new ideas of new kinds of games that they can play. Your life doesn't always depend on the game, because we always have something else to do even if we have a game and it is always hard to find what time you are going to play the game. It is how the life will be when you are a grown up. Our lives always give us surprises that we don't expect. Sports are the most important thing in our lives, because they helps us overcome our fears of communicating with people.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

Those who believe that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy have their reasons. One of the most disputed reason is that, our school does not use it resorces and energy in vain, beause we use energy and resorces to facilitate our studies and to have better opportunities to learn. And they also say that if we have a four-day school week wont make any change.

However, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours of school day because we will have a better environment.

Even more, it says that because the over abuse of resorces in our school the amount of trees cutted has enhace around our county and its harming our enviroment."" That is giving a bad reputation to our school and county because our school does not recycle and reused our resorces .

Also, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours because we will administrate energy.

Our school has the biggest amount of students in all the county. So, do to the amount of students in our school the use of computers has increased. According to an save energy a webside, ""80% of schools energy is used in computers and other technical divises.""

Thing out in the world are not like they used to be. A city council is debating on a curfew adoption. If this curfew is adopted does this mean teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Will curfews keep teens out of trouble or unfairly interfere with their lives?

A city council is debating on an adoption of curfew for teens. Why are they debating about this adoption? The first reason is city council does not want teens getting hurt or putting themselves at risk at a young age. Second, they want to keep teenagers safe from the bad things out in the world. Lastly is they do not want trouble, some teens make bad choices about drinking and other stuff they should not do at a young age. That is why city council is debating a curfew adoption.

If the curfew adoption is adopted by city council, does it mean that teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Many people have different opinions. I also think it depends on why they are out. I would say they are not breaking any law if its for work or any emergency. They are also not breaking the law if they are with an adult because it is not like they are on their on there own. However if they are out to be hanging out with friends and partying stuff like that, yes the would be breaking the law. Does this mean if teens are out they are breaking the law? In some ways yes and in some ways no, it depends on why they are out pass the curfew.

Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble or unfairly interfere in young lives? First things first most teens would say that by having the curfew law its interfering with there lives. Teens would say that because they want to go out and have funny and other stuff. having the curfew law will keep teens safe and out of trouble because you never know what could happen. Another reason i would say keeps them out of trouble is because most teens like to leave the house at night with out their parents knowing. That is never something you should do. Teens should think, Is it worth the risk? A lot of things can happen even though you may think everything is okay and that nothing will happen, but that is what you think there might be a chance you could be wrong. Now teens should think, Do curfews keep them safe or does it interfere win there lives?

The city council's debate about the adoption of curfew for teenagers. Many believe it should be a law and others believe its should not be a law. They debate upon this law because they want to keep teens safe and do not want them to get hurt or in trouble at a young age. Will it mean that any teen on the streets after curfew is breaking the law? It Will probably depend on why they are out for example for work or for and emergency and unless they are with an adult. Some reasons other than that like to go to parties or hang with friends, is most likely breaking the law. Will this law keep teens out of trouble or interfere with there lives? Most teens opinions would be that this law is interfering with their lives. Some teens most likely parents will say it's to keep teens safe instead of risking themselves.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0
B596C01C5E87,"Considering businesses have adopted a four-day week , is probably good for them. On the other hand, maybe students in school can handle that. This would come to no harm for our society. We could make this a habit if we wanted it to be, just have to take some action in this. More energy would increase if this would happen. It could change many things, specially recourses. This also can come with responsibilities

Well , were trying to help students out more if we change a full week, to a 4-day week. Their would be no harm. Although , it may effect some students. I feel that, more energy, will come more as students. Coming to school with more energy to a 4-day weekend, students would often get things done more. This would be no harm to us. A full week might just be little too much. If businesses changed the policy for a 4-day week, why not us schools change that. This would benefit us students to get things done. Some of us students have sports or work after school. This policy would benefit us to do better in school and out of school. If schools allowed this , students would benefit this as a gift. If we would be able to take a vote on this, I personally think our schedule would be changed for good. Although, this policy can come with some responsibilities. Maybe most of us students can also handle this policy.

By extending school day for 2 more hours isn't a bad thing. Maybe for this policy to change, would require more school hours in the day. Furthermore, some of us students wouldn't mind that. Regardless, this helps us get more energy for sleep hours by making it a 4-day week. energy is important in this topic. Although, this helps our environment with no harm. This wouldn't be a problem overall. For example, How much energy would be transferred into a 4-day school week than a full week, way more and their is nothing wrong with that.

By handling business, taking care of things, it's all about responsibilities at the end of the day. All were trying to do is help our community and our resources. Students would benefit this and would be a helpful to us. As us students would have to take action into this situation. End of the day, we just want this to help us for the real world and specially after high schools or college. This could all depends the energy we bring also. If this policy would change, we will all be still in good hands.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
3CACE02FBD5C,"There is a debate about if do we accomplish more if we are always doing something or does inactivity also serve a purpose. Some people think that is not necessary be always doing something. They feel that they need to have some extra time to be with their family and be a person that always is doing something will take away that time. In my opinion is more satisfactory be always doing something because the more you are busy doing good things or thinking and what you can do is a help to not get involve in horrible things or and drugs, you will have the opportunity to be able to give all your family need and deserve, and also you will have the satisfaction of be a good example for your kids and a support to the society.

The people that is involve in drugs, the people that get out to the streets to steal to can survive those people easily give up and did not try to find another way to get ahead, that people who make drugs, to sell drugs or the ones that consume drugs that people are living a dangerous life they are always hidden for the police or hidden because bad people are looking for them. They probably did not have another option or just they did not effort on doing something and all that thoughts became to do what they thought was easy.

Being a person that is active and always is making new things that person can be certain that they family will have everything. That person know that their kids will have the opportunity to go to school and get a excellent education. That person know that in the house will never be short of food, clothe and health. All that and more you and your family will have if you make the right choices and keep always doing new things or always be doing things and keep busy.

Now in our society good and hard working people is almost are scarcity because now some people the work in some countries the people doe not want to work they prefer be in their home doing nothing. But the people who is working those people are making the change for this society that people will become a example for all the kids but they will be a support a big support for the community.

There are some reasons why I think that the people that is always doing something accomplish more that the people that does not do anything. Is a complete satisfaction to know that all the you have is because yo worked for it and you work hard and like Thomas Jefferson said the determination never be end is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something. We can make a lot of things but we just have to have dedication and love what you do. ",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

Online class are not easy not anybody can pass thats why they not meant for everyone. Being home schooled is nothing like regular school you don't have to wake early, you get to choose what time you do your work.

Not having to wake up early everyday is nice but knowing you have to get something done right after you start is not fun and specially if you not getting the help you need not being able to ask the questions you have makes it a lot harder,

you also have to try and do your best because if you fail you can't talk to your teacher about helping you make it up and helping you pass it like regular school.

If you are home schooled you missing out the fun in regular schools not talking about class meaning all the fights, all the fire drills, all the dances and friends sometimes having trouble in regular school i always tell myself i need to drop out or take online classes but home schooled is not just for everybody and probably at least 60% of home schooled students either don't finish or go back to regular school.

I would like to tell you about how I think about doing community service. The reason I wanted to tell you about this is because I understand that some students would like to do community service and not others. In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. If the students that want to do community service can do that. If there is only a small group of people than it would not be a good way to have the work done. Please consider this and if you don't like this than it will be fine to me. My other reason is not everyone would like to pick up liter. It might not be what students want to do during there free time. I understand that your the principal of this school and not every principal would consider this opinion because you believe that everyone should do community service. I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service and I also like to tell you that there should be a list of places that there going to do service at.

Like when you aim low like only work in fastfood and only get paid minimum wage forever, then get a job for a company like samsung of nintendo and get paid more then that.

1 of the examples is the debt/taxes you want to live a good life when you're down here right so do you want to live with so little money or more money that you save from a good job.

My 2nd example of this is like athletes if you learn what you did right, or wrong to achive that goal you have to push yourself further then what you are right now.

87DF9FF7104D,"Albert Einsteins said "" I am afraid that one day the technology outdo the human brain."" He was afraid that one day the technology controls humanity. In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on people's lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. in the actuality the people act like robots. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games.

However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on people's live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. they go to the internet and look for solution.

another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. I am going to expose my family and friends. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. In addition the technology expose our private life. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide.

in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. The technology is opaquing our intellect. The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself. The effects of the technology cause ours children, teenagers are negative and we only watch how the future of the world is going down. ",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

In my opinion, I think that people should seek guidance form experts and authorities, for many reasons this solution has prove to be effective, if a person listens to other people opinions, then the decision the person makes will not be base only on his/her opinion.

First, lets say if a male person seek guidance from experts and authorities when taking a decision, it shows that he is obedient and he will not act recklessly when taking a decision about his life, it shows that he is willing to listen to other people perspectives.

Second, in my opinion i think that asking for guidance shows matureness, it shows that you care about yourself and others opinion, it also shows wiseness when you ask others for guidance first so you can decide and make the best decision.

In conclution, people should seek guidance from experts when taking a decision about their life, I think that if people set aside their pride and worries, we humans would make better choices not just for us but for our entire environment which it also includes other species.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

every plas have good and bad opinions many student at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them dont like to eat halthy they just wnat to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasenable and i undestand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food but we all love that kind of food, is delicius and it taste great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kidn of food.

To keep a balance and for the students to be better and feel better about them self i think it will be the best to have a schedule of food for example :monday healthy food, Tuesday bad food...

Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.

The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues.

Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy. There was a day when I was out with my friends on shopping. We went to mall together. I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be.

Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.                                                                                          ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
B7C150A40F86,"It is known, that students truly enjoy the most they can any break of the year. Giving a break to students in the evening and all summer, is better for their process of graduation. That is why, students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating.

First of all, since students have so much schoolwork and homework to study, they often need a break, so that way they can relax in their home and do other activities with their family that are not related to school. Summer is a season in which students need to go out in vacations and spend time with their family as well. Generally, not every students and their families get to spend so much time all together in the evenings, that is because of their routine. Most parents have from their jobs summer break, and they prefer enjoying it together with their children. It would be unfair for them to have to not enjoy that much their summer with their children just because the students have courses during the summer.

Another reason of why students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating, is because after they graduate, they are more prepared for the career they decide doing. It would not be a recommendable period of time having three years of high school for students that still need to keep studying and preparing themselves for the career that they are going to study in college. The students can get more experience while they are reaching to their goal which is their graduation.

In high school, every student should have at least an idea of what they are going to be dedicating themselves for the rest of their lives, and most of them suffer by not knowing what career to choose. Some students may say that they would really wish graduating as soon as possible, but the fact is, that by being in a hurry of getting out of high school with a diploma, they would make the mistake by maybe choosing the wrong career in college for themselves, or even maybe deciding to not go to college just because they did not have the enough time of high school to think and decide the options that colleges offer. Giving students more time for this particular decision is a good way to let them know what they are capable of doing in their future.

In conclusion, students having four years of high school includes many benefits that can help them to be more prepared for college, rest more in summer, and giving them a better process of high school for their future in college and job. Students can challenge themselves by experiencing the traditional four years of high school and see the advantages of the result that they reached which will be very beneficial for them.

BB430219DBB4,"In my opinion it's not a good idea because in every country in world it's role that student have to study 12 yeaer in the then have to go to college. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they don't like school the only reason they don't like the school is that they wake up early and they can't sleep. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. it's good if someone want to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experiance.

In the other country's the rule in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 book in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if any one get the first position the president will gave him gift and some money also. The most university are 4 year but only docter have to study 7 years.

Our response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that it's not good to graduate early because you didn't learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. there is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they can't answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he did'nt learn the thing that he need it in the college or univerrsity.

Working in school time is not good for student, because he can't learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work and he is coming from work night and he sleep so when he will study if he did'nt study he can't graduate. it's rule that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school and he is 18 it's not to work his family have to support him to study. It's family responsibilty to tell his child to study. when he gradute then he have to work because he dosen't have to study too much because collage is easy that school.

I hope they change the rule that when student finish thire class and pass ESOL than the are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focuse on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didn't study the other subjects then why thay make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new rule.

97167C9DC677,"Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. In activity does serve a purpose by showing maturity; however, people accomplish more if we are doing something. People accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals.

Firstly,people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. In a everybody lives or in today's era, everyone wants to achieve greatness, but by achieving greatness people often or need to start from the bottom of their league or what I like to call ""THE CASTLE STANDARD"". In The Castle Standard each have their own class their, the bottom league is the beginner class, the middle is the amateur class, and the highest class is The Hall of Fame class AKA HOFC. Each person start from the bottom to get to the top, by starting from the bottom they can show higher authorities what they are capable off. For example, there was a movie called The Pursue of Happiness, the people in the movie was Will Smith and his son. The movie was about how a man, who worked at a business company as a mere employee, he and his son was kicked out of the apartment and they were homeless, they were trying to find a new home, so they started to live in a homeless shelter, but that didnt stop Will Smith from going to work. He went to work even though he was homeless. They authorities he worked with knew his situation, and they knew his dedication to his dedication to the company,so they decided to make him CEO of the company. In the end he got higher paid he was of the greatest CEO in the company and he was able to get a new house for him and his son. Furthermore people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence.

Secondly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. People often shows determination, once they set their mind doing something they personally want to achieve or accomplish. In people mindset have something they want like, saving up money to buy an expensive item or staying on task to get a promotion at your work place. Determination is also one of the characteristics of positive attitude that leads people a success in life. There also shows determination when they are trying to reach their goals in what they want to become in their future. For example, the movie I used in the first paragraph The Pursue of Happiness. Will smith even though he had a situation which he was homeless, he had job at the company and he was in a huge situation with the company. The situation was they wanted to fire him to give him time to set his life or plan his life with his son, since he was homeless and they are living in the homeless shelter. He showed determination to the job and gave them a huge reason why the should keep him at the company. because he solved the companies huge problem which almost led the company to bankrupt, so the authorities decided to keep him in the company and give him promotion and a huge check to be able to sustain his daily life with his son. I believe that people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination.

Lastly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. In everyone life has goal, there is no human being in this Earth who doesnt have a goal. The goal can start from High school or middle school or somewhere were people have been brought out by their culture. In every goal there is a purpose why that person is setting that goal, maybe it could be huge reason like impressing your family or following your idol and so on, but by setting your goals people often need to plan how they can achieve that goal. For example, in TC Williams High School my goal is to join the Airforce, but by doing that I needed to take specific subjects that can help me or give me the experience towards my goal. I had to take Aerospace, JROTC, physics, and this was kind of personal ,but I had to take PE/Fitness for a physic body structure, so that I wont be weak,fat or plumply when I join the Airforce. So I had to take step by step or take my time to accomplish my goal. Furthermore, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals.

In conclusion, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Also by stating you rmind on what you want to do people can make remarkable or impossible things that might shocked the world. I think the right thing to do is for people to accomplish more if they have set their mind on something extraordinary or even more enhance.    ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

If I could go any place in the world it would be Jamaica because there are many places you could go to do activities, there is a variety of food,and different types animals.

I would go to Jamica because there are many places to go to do activites like a mountain or a beach. There are many activites I would like to do at a beach or mountain. I would swim at a beach so I could feel the fresh water. I would also climb the mountains to feel the fresh air. I would want to sigh see at the top of a mountain. Since there are creatures in the water I could look for them. I would like also just laying on the sand and enjoy the weather.

I would also go to Jamaica because there is a variety of food. I could find the variety of foods in reasturaunts, on tropical trees, and in a creek. I could find rice and beans in reasturaunts. I could find coconut and banana on a tropical tree. I could also find crayfish in the water and other fish. If you catch a crayfish or regular fish I would fry it. If there is a variety of foods then I could change my eating style while I am there.

Lastly I would go to Jamiaca because there are different types of animals. I would probably find chickens or other birds that fly or run. Also I could find stray dog that roam around the streets. I would like to find fish that have claws or fish that have fins. I might find frogs that are poisonous and ones that are not. I think I could find goats roaming around eating peoples plants. I could also find snakes that have fangs or are poisonous.

I would go to Jamaica because there are many places to go to do activities, variety of foods, and different types of animals. This place is unique compared to others and also this place has lot of nature. This is why I would want to go to Jamaica If I could go to any place in the world.        ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5
CAAB28864F44,"In this new year that we are now there are thosands of enjoyable and educational activitys. They can be fun because you get to do alot of things with them. These activitys should be done because they are very fun.

An activity can be fun is like playing a sport their are alot of sports out there that can be fun and aggresive but its exciting to play a sport because you get to go on trips and you get to verse other teams or with only one player. you get to even become a professional player

I played soccer for about two years and now i am good at it. Before in elemantary school i used to be bad at it and used to say ""im bad at this"" or ill say ""im not good at it"" but then i entered in a summer soccer program every evening or in the day i would go to a school and we would go to a soccer field. nI really loved that activity because you learn more and become good at it.

Another activity that can be fun and cool and enjoyable is playing an insturment. It is fun because i used to play an insturment the last three years and it was fun because you get to go to trips. Last year me and my friends went to Generic_City. We went with the orchestra class, band, and even chores. it was fun. and its nice to play an insrument because you have alot of oppsions to choose from and you even get to play nice soothing music or loud and extreame. And the fun part is that you get to be in a stage with your friends and play music infront of the audiance.

Another enjoyable activity is chemistry its fun because you get to mix different chemicals to objects or chemical to chemical. Me and my science class will be doing it this year i am happy to do it becaue i never mixed chemicals or never put on science goggles. i cant wait to do it this year we will be doing chemisry in april. Mixing chemicals can be hard and scary because what happens if you mix the chemcals and something happens in chemistry you have to be very careful with what chemicals are you mixing together.

I am very happy because you have thosands or hundres of activitys to choose from because their are alot of people who are loking for a good and fun activity. so i recommend you to go look for an activity that fits yoou right and that enjoyable and educational.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.0
125C1167A84A,"Mrs. Generic_Name i think changing the school menu is a very bad idea because the students will not have many choices of what they wanna eat in the cafeteria. so the student wouldnt get to eat what they like or of their favorite choice what the student usually get when they are in the cafeteria. and the students wouldnt be happy about changing the school menu and most student would go to school and not eat lunch and go home with their stomach empty.

so Generic_Name i would not recommend not changing the school menu because. the student would not be very happy at school and if the school menu changes. mostly the student would will bring their own lunch from home and bring it in to the cafeteria and the school lunch food would be wasting . because the students wouldnt eat the school lunch food because majorly the student are bring their own lunch. which its not a very bad idea because students can bring their own lunch and they will not be starving to death with out skipping lunch and going going home with their stomach full instead of empty which it is a good thing. so i think not changing the school menu is a very good idea because friend and i can have free choices of what i like to eat and what the whole school would like to eat or bring the Owen lunch to school which i think it a very good idea because if i had the freedom to to bring my own lunch or choice in the cafeteria. i would eat very well and i wont have an empty stomach the whole entered day in school. and i will not be sleepy for the rest of the day and the few class i have at the end of the day.

i think sum of the students will do the same thing as me if we all eat very good and very well in school in the cafeteria and it will be nice.

Mrs. Generic_Name i think that most student would not like to have a healthier school lunch menu becuase no student usaly get school lunch in school so the students usaly bring in their own school lunch and which its a very good go idea because the student can bring what they like to eat during lunch time .and if you change the school lunch menu then the student wouldnt get school lunch any more. and if the whole school didnt jget the school lunch any more because they dont like the new school lunch menu. it because no one like to eat very healthy at school and maybe if the whole school didnt get lunch and every single student in Generic_School pack their own lunch with its a bad sin becuse all the food would be wasting . so mrs Generic_Name pelase dont change the school lunch menu becuase most student wouldnt be happy if the school lunch menu changes and every every student in Generic_School would be so happy and glad if you didnt change the school lunch mean.

Best support for your idea is examples. I think is the only thing for support your idea. You don't have other options But never mind you have a one more way for influence others everybody know this way because is the best way of everything it is the money.

Once upon a time me and my friend talking about one film (i did not remember the film name know.) we are saying only examples (because we know is the best way for support our ideas) he is saying one example i am saying another and we are talking like a 30 or 35 min finally i gave up and i said if you accept my idea i will buy a large size pizza and he said OK.

E3097287CBD1,"Some school offer distances learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they won't learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help.

Some student often have a bad day so they often don't pay attention and they just don't do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think that's okay because no one is watching them. Many of them don't learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student won't benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they don't have someone to talk too.

Online classes don't benefit students because they don't have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they won't get it because they don't a teacher with them. so they just don't understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they won't do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes won't help student in their life. one example is that they won't have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they don't know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don't have the opportunity to chat with them.

When students get video conferencing they don't really understand because something the video don't really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing.

Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. let's Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest,

but they did'it because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport.

Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they won't learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work. In my personal option school should not have online classes or video conferencing. Student are going to have a better knowledge if they go to school and, they work with teacher. School should let student enjoy take their high school life and not have online classes.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0
1BA1FD29BF69,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change.

I agree that the first impressions are the ones that are impossible to change, because impressions from other person can make you feel proud for that person, and impressions from other people about you can just make you feel good and happy for what you are doing, for your hard work.

Reason of why the first impressions are impossible to change, is when you find those negative and envy people, that does not want you to be successful in life, and when the time came at your favor and you start to begin success in life, there is when you start to see those good impressions from those negative and envy people, and that just can make you feel happy and proud for the hard work that you did, that is why is almost impossible to change those impressions, because not matter what you showed them you always looked forward, but still don't hate them, love them as God loves everyone in this world.

No matter what give good impressions and show them, let them know that they are working hard, people who works hard deserve good impressions, make them feel proud for what they are doing, and also no matter what give good impressions, show people how hard worker, how positive, how respectful person you are, show them that you always look forward not matter what, so when other people talk bad stuffs about you, your ones does not going to believe or change those good impressions from you, because you already showed them that good impressions you keep with you...",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

45A86623B659,"Do you agree or disagree about the importance of attitude? I agree with the importance of attitude, because with your atitude you can motivate yourself to do the best in your life, and you can motivate other people to do the best in their life. Some people think that in this life your positive attitude is the key to do good in everything, because if you go to any place, job, or to the school with positive attitude your life its going to be excellent.

In this life the success is the key, because if people have negative attitude in everywhere, they just don't want to nothig. For example, if they go to the school/collage with negative attitude, maybe they don't want to learn new things about the class, because they are going to be mad, and they don't want to do work with negative attitude, but if the people go with positive attitude they can learn averything they want, or learn more than they know about the class, because be positive means that you want be success in your life, also means that people want to do the best in everything.

Second, people can do better in this life with positive attitude, because they want be graduated from collage wih positive attitude, and with them positive attituted they maybe motive to other people to do the same thing, with their positive attitude they learn more, they are going to do work, homework, and classwork, because in this life the key is the attituded, that means everything you do, do with positive attitute,if you do that you are going to learn new things easy.

Some people argue that in this life you don't need positive attitude, because they only think if you pay attention, do homework, and finish classwork in the school/ collage so you can be success in this life, they only think about to be responsible with their works, not about to have positive attitude. People also argue that in the works you don't need positive attitude, because the only thing you need is experience, work, and be resposible.

In conclusion, if you do everything with positive attitude we can learn things more easy, and you are going to be success in this life, because you motivate yourself to do the best, also you can motivate people to do the same thing, to be success in this life, with positive attituded you can do everything, because you want to learn new things in this life.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5
4D7E52C79A3D,"Does students think that learning from home would be helpful for them? Learning from home won't be as helpful as much as you go to school and learn in the class from teacher. I don't think that students would learn anything from video or online conference because if they don't learn anything while their at school, so how would they learn from home. They might have work at home or at outside, which makes them distracted or disturbed them from their work, and they might have problems with it. Every student has the right to make their decision but this idea won't work out.

Mostly, in every home there is problem which we don't want to share with anyone or we don't want anyone to know about what is happening in our home. Like fighting with mom, brother or father anyone in home or we might don't want anyone to know why are fighting. I mean people have privacy in their life or difficulties which they don't want to share with anyone, and even if they do the work from home it might not help as much as we are in school.

Commonly, every student is not equally intelligent so they can understand one thing in one time. Most of the time and most student take a long time to understand one thing in this situation if they decide to put distance learning then those student might not understand clearly and of course they won't come to school, so they can have a day off.

I mean if a student can't learn something from school how could he or she learn from home.

However, every student want to learn more and achieve something and most of them don't even care. The person who want to achieve something always try their best to do it, but the person don't care would get a chance to not learn. I mean everyone want to relax in home because school work are really tough, but even after that every student try their best to learn and distance learning can't help it out. if you are out somewhere and you're teacher is trying to teach you in online you might not get what they are saying.

However, some people might think that distance learning might help them but if they can't learn in school then how will they learn when they are not in school. I don't think if you are far away from school so you can learn anything from that. Anyway I don't think that students or the teacher might have that time to talk to every student or teacher to ask question or answer them. One teacher can handle a class together, but same teacher can't handle every student differently, so I don't think that this idea would work.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5
A9A152AAFBE1,I would be interested in joining a program that you guys have to offer. I am very interested in automobiles and would want to look for any companies where I could work on vehicles as my career opportunity. I've always loved the idea that I could one day learn about cars; how a vehicle gets off of the assembly line to the road. There are many companies that are in demand for mechanics to turn wrenches and do not care that they are going to get their hands dirty on the job and for me I would be happy just doing that for a long time. Ever since I was a kid i've worked on my dads' and uncles' car. By changing their tires and putting the tires back and doing oil changes to tuning and modifying my uncles car from a stock making two-hundred horsepower to eight-hundred horsepower. Ever since i've had experience with vehicles in my life time and working in a companies to get my degree and one day open my shop and be able to work on cars would be a dream come true. When I got older I started reading books about cars from the first ever made vehicle to where you had to crank to start the car to when technology was slowly progressing and that was not a thing anymore. Through out the years technologies have increased dramatically and vehicles are being driven by them selves and I would love to work on self derivable vehicles because I know that I would be able to make it right and make sure that the customer is always the priority and I am always hundred percent and determined to make the vehicle an high functioning machine with so much capabilities. I would love to one day work for Tesla or BMW in making electric to hybrid vehicles and knowing that it would be a fun career option while doing something that I always loved ever since I was a little boy I would be grateful. ,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
2EA9DA7AAD2C,"Thomas Jefferson said ""determine never to be idle."" What he means is that people should not just sit there and do nothing for their whole life because it won't help them accomplish their goals. Some people say doing something serves a purpose. Others say that inactivity also serves a purpose. Doing nothing at all is a bad choice. The best option to serve a purpose is to actually do something by helping others and the world then staying idle and not doing anything to help others.

First, the reason why Thomas Jefferson said that people should never be idle is because he wants to change their lives forever. Another reason why people should take this advantage is that if people don't do any activities in their life, then they won't be able to achieve their goals in the future. Most people will say this, ""doing something serves a purpose because it could help other people get their work done."" It's good to start doing activities at a younger age because they will be able to experience it and get used to it later on. Also, doing activities can help them gain more respect and they could get famous. It could be too late to start doing activities when they are older, but people just have to think of what they are going to do to fix it.

Next, most people will say that they don't know what activity they should do. For example, i didn't want to do any activites like other people did so i went and did karate for 4 years. A year later I started to swim every Saturday and eventually I have been getting better. After that I started to go to the gym from Monday through Thursday every single week. It's not too late to start an activity at a younger age, but for an older age it could be. The people just got to work hard if they want to achieve their goal, but the only way they could do it is if they can believe that they can do this.

In addition, other people think that not doing any activity serves a purpose. They say that because they think their parents do most of the work so they don't have to do any of it. Also, there are people who are just lazy and don't care about their life. Others think that doing activities doesn't really achieve their goal in the future. Most people just don't know what they want to do in life.

Lastly, Thomas Jefferson doesn't want people to be idle for their whole life because he wants to help them do activities that they think its interesting. Another reason why people should take an advantage of this, so when they are young, they will understand of what is gonna happen in their future, and then as they get older, they will have full potential by doing it. Also, it will help them and other people get the job done. They will not have to struggle in their future. The thing about activities is to never give up, even if they mess up its ok, they just need to practice and practice nonstop.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
AD9CEE5A6FFF,"I think it better to talk to more people than just one person, why becase different people have a different way of viewing a situation. People act differnet, one person might be angry and the other might be happy. Thats one of the reasons why i think its better to talk to more people than just one person.

You can see how different poeple think by just starting a conversation, different people might have better advice than others becase of the way they think or how they were taught to do things. Its also good to talk to the people that have been through your situation becase they have been through it and they can give you tips on how to be positive or how to be relaxed in that situition if it ever happens agian.

You can also talk to your familiy members becase they are are close people that you can always trust to help you like a project or just homework things like that so it doesent stress you out so much. Its good to know that someone will always be there to help you out. Thats way i think its better to talk do different people not just one person.

15F6B5C6229A,"I will agree with the Emerson's statement,but this can depend too the point view. This is one of the example:

There is a men who is an entrepreneur and he have a little company,and he decide to make it more big,but he don't know if he is going to do it. If you don't try to do it you will never grow, you have to do new things for you know you will have to try something beyond of you already mastered.

The way I understand this is if you don't try to do something that you already know, you will never learn a new things that you don't know,because there is not way to grow if you don't over pass your self or you don't try it and that is going to provoke that you can't advance to grow or even stock in the way you try to make to grow.

Example: When I was 15 years old, the only thing I did was just studying. Although when I start to think about my future and then I figure out I have to do more than just studying, I have to choose which college I'm going and work to earn money for I can pay my college and expenses I have in my house or personal,because you have to do something for you can over pass your goals or you will never grow.

But some people maybe think or have different opinions about this,perhaps people say like its a lie or you can't do it because it's impossible and also that is fake. Every one don't thing the same, maybe they a different point to see it,they just don't want or they have a another way to grow. The majority of people are going to say yes,because they already lived the moment that if you want to grow, you have to go beyond of the things you already know or you'll never going to trust your self.

My opinion is that maybe this wrote of Emerson is true and the reason why i'm saying this is that you have to do things new and over pass your self ,and doesn't matter if you already mastered something,if you want to grow you have to try it because you can't grow if you don't do different things that you have not idea about how you can grow and make or dominate more things that you can't believe.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5
F4FC2D64C127,"Inactive Times and Its Benefits

Should people have inactive times in their life? By doing work all the time people can achieve more goals; however, is better for people to have inactive times. It is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy.

Firstly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life. People's body works better when they have time to rest. For example, my mother's friend had a heart attack for not having inactive times. His doctor recommend him to have lazy times because he was working eighteen hours per day, but he did not listen to what the doctor said. As a consequence, he pass away; however, before he was told to have inactive times, his Neuron System stopped working properly. He stared having bad times at night while he was sleeping, his body started shaking, and he started having heavy breathing. The doctor asked my mother to talk to him and explained one of bad results, and that was death. Right after my mother's friend pass away, the doctor wrote on his blog about how not having inactive times can kill us. In sum, having inactive times help people live a longer life.

Secondly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have fresh ideas. When our brain is full of tasks we cannot think clearly and have new ideas. Being busy makes our mind blocked. For example, Generic_Name is a teacher and she is planning to have a party. However, Generic_Name is been so busy because her class is having a competition. All she thinks about is the competition and how to prepared her class. Generic_Name is not having inactive times and she does not know how to organized the party. She tried to focused on the party, but each small action was in vane. Her boss noticed she was tired and did not have new ideas, so her boss let her have two days off. During those two day Generic_Name could came up with lots of ideas to her party and also ideas to the competition. Generic_Name was happy because her main was full of new and fresh ideas. Her class won the competition and her party was amazing. In conclusion, by having inactive times people can get fresh ideas.

Thirdly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they get more energy. People who rest feel more energetic to start or finish an activity. For example, when I have many homework ,exams coming up, and track practice I feel upset, frustrated, and with no energy. So what I do is rest for a while to get energy. This make me feel powerful and energetic to finish my different activities. Furthermore, in my Psychology class I learned that people who rest or get an inactive time after they done with an activity for twenty five minutes have more energy to continue another task. In my personal experience, I have tested it on my sister and the results were successful. For example, She had to do an Algebra II homework and then, an English homework. So when she took the first twenty five minutes after she finished her first homework she said, she had energy to do the other one. We test it again without having twenty five minutes break. She said she was tired to do the next homework because she did not have energy. In sum, it is better for people to have inactive times because get more energy.

In conclusion, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy.

People can faced catastrophic result as death by not having inactive times and affect our life time. In addition, when people have lazy times they can came up with new ideas to complete different tasks. Finally, when people rest a certain time after an activity they get more energy. Each individual on earth must have an inactive times. ",3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

Should people make their own decisions, or shoud they seek guidance from experts and authorties.

If you take decisions, you can have a good life for you'r future. For Exmaple if you want go to the College but you talk with your self and said no go to the college because you not are Intelligent, so you try to deisions go to the college or not go.

you can take your own decisions,For Example: if you take one decisions are bad or no the people need to repect you'r decisions because is you'r decisions,So They not want to know why you take that decisions in my opinion the people only want the bad for you.

You can take more control about you'r decisions,For Example: you can have more control about you'r decisionsFor Example:you can have more control about you'r decisions if you control you'r decisions you can take good decisions and that is good for take decisions

So, you need to have contro about decisions.

you can have you'r own decisions is good to take you'r decisions because you have more capacity to take other decisions, So in my opinion is good to have a decisions because can help to you in the Future but if you take something good for you'r life or for decisions.

In Conclucion: Should people make their own decisisons, or should they seek from experts and Authories. Take decisions for you is good because you can have good life for the future,if you want go to the college but you talk with you'r self and no go to the college because you not are Intelligent, so you try to decisisons go to the college or not go.

6B3B3CB54EB9,"My opinion about conserve energy and resources.

I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things.

I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week.

My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do.

Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students.

My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think.

My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they don't add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5

It might be a life changing for me to see how they live there maybe i might start being greatful for what i have and they dont and i would start helping others mor often.

One reason i would go to portorico is to see how they do stuff different like what they wear,what they eat, and what they do on daly it would be intersting seeing all that and i would like to try new food and wear the cloths they wear and try to see how it feels to be a portorican.

Another reason i would love to go to portorico is because at the USA i am not greatful for what i have and maybe if if i go over to portorico i will be greatful for what i have because i will see the difference of how i live and how they live it will also melt my heart to see them eating unhealth and i am over here throwing my food away because i dont want it.

My final reason for wanting to go to portorico is because i will want to see how their parents are with the kids like when they get in trouble. I also want to see how teachers are with their students when they get in trouble because i want to see if they are different than El Salvador cause there they hit their students with the ruler and that is not okay.

In conclution I would like to see every difference they have from the USA and El Salvador and i want to try every food that they have and spend time with students.

F91EFD0443E6,"Have you ever though of people who use technology has limit their communication to others? Nowadays people who use technology are consistent spending their time on electronic device. Technology has a negative impact on human lives due to their daily routine.

The first reason is people's communication skills will decrease over time. Spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. Therefore, talking to someone who you haven't talked with for a while can be awkward. This shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be.

The second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. For example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. This shows a sign of danger, because you won't be hearing anything. People who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. This shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident.

Some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. If you are communicate in person you can read the person's mood. You can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. In this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before.

The final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. For example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the people's preferance. You can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. You can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. Unlike books, have no battery which means it doesn't have any limit. This shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device.

In conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. People should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. There should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. Is better to communicate in person and don't wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. This affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology.",3.5,3.5,4.5,3.0,3.5,4.0
B469122B9ACB,"Success Consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I think he is said is right you never give up on anything, you are always going to wings and sometimes you are going to fail. Because thats how you are going to wing never giving up. There is a lot of stuffs that I been done on my life, that now i start thinking i never finish what I start. But I dont give up i know I m going to end up doing them soon. for example there is a lot of people that have the motivation, then they start winning and fail ones and they give up. when you love something you gotta chases it because then you are never going have it.

Failure is a really strong word that nobody likes to like that hear some students get upset for failing a test or class they cant be late because they want to win is just like work if you want to start getting paid more you always gotta be on time and all that. so you can become better everyday. Soccer is one example about success soccer you got to learn a lot of new stuffs, Because you have to do a lot of practice. To win you gotta do something,and do it right all time. We all hate failing I hate failing, I always think that is just a waste of time. I fail so many times but i never give up because I know that I gotta finish what I started ow you are going to success

Enthusiasm thats whats the way to success on your dreams if never use that enthusiasm to do something you are going to be good at it you might fail more than ones but still think about what is going to give you. And just think positive that you are gone be sussefull. Lets said that i m trying to go to collage and I stared to work and stared to get a lot of money and all that. then I think about going back to collage and think of all the work that they do and all that im not going to keep going. Because I lost the enthusiasm that i had. Why because I stared to get more stuffs, and I wont feel success

Thats why i agree with what The britishs prime minister Winston Churchill said. That to get where you what you got to fight.

9C601D9FCB5F,"Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think it's bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they don't want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them.

In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people don't go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they don't know who they are. Some of these people might say that there's no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, there's a risk when you talk to this people online and it's the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what they're doing, and that's how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we don't know if it's real.

When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they don't want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time won't help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didn't have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now don't want to get out where technology is at.

Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, it's hard to make a kid stop use technology. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them.

Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we don't control the use of technology.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

They say it makes people feel lazy and depend on it so much and without they feel like they can't get nothing done. Although, technology has a negative effects on people lives, I believe that its positive effects is greater for few reasons.

First reason, it allows people to do much more in less time. We can complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, people can check out books, shop, and learn without having to go no where or speaking to another person. Not only that it saves us time it also saves lives.

Another reason, it helps us and others on emergency situations. For example, we are able to make emergency calls at any given time for help without having to go no where. Also, we can call to report someone or something that will harm us and others. Not only we can call for emergency we can also call people we care about that we cant reach.

Final reason, We are able to talk to people we care about and love that we can't reach. For example, If your parents or someone you care about are in a different state or country, and you want to check in on them you can just call them without having to go or travel to them. This what makes technology a positive effect on our lives because it makes everything easy.

In conclusion, technology has a positive effect on people lives because we can save time, save lives, and contact people we care about. This why technology has a positive effect on our lives. But at the end of the day it all depends on you and how you want to use it you can make it positive or negative to your life.       ",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
FF6224AC70C6,"A city council is having arguments to adopt curfew for teenagers,10 P.M on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Some people thinks this to be a good idea,but others especially like young people does not think so. There are conflicting opinions over this topic. According to me this is a good idea to set a limit for teenagers who stay away from home late night. In my opinion,this adoption can lead to improvement in sleeping habits of teenagers,prevents unhealthy food habits and allow teens to spend more time with their families.

Curfews to stop teenagers going out of home late night make them improve their sleep time. As they are home they sleep on better time than they are out till midnight. For young people sleep time should be 7-8 hours atleast,because of their growing body structure. Young people are more energetic if they sleep well. Staying out late disturbs bed time for teens,which makes them lazy,tired and inactive in activities going on around us. Unadequate sleep can also lead to risk in driving a vehicle. As you could not sleep well you may feel dizziness while driving a vehicle,which is really dangerous. A lot of teens die in road crashes because of unattentiveness while driving,this unattentiveness comes from unadequate sleep. Also the crashes are caused due to drink and drive habits after staying out late night. To protect teens from death in that early age curfews should be adopted. As when me myself could not sleep well,I am unable to concentrate on my work in my class. This alot of times effects my grades. Also when I stay awake till late night separates me from what is going on in real world because when people around me are awake,I am not focused and asleep.

This adoption also somehow effects teens eating habits. Staying out means eating unhealthy and junk food,which is not at all good for young people's health. Along with adequate sleep we also should be healthy to stay fresh and active. It is really necessary for young people to eat healthy food because they have their full life to live and if they will stay unhealthy,they will get diseases in really early age. Not only food when teens go out with friends they drink alcohol or beer, which is not good for them at that early age. Unhealthy food weakens teens immune system which leads to diseases in quite early ages. Not only diseases unhealthy food collects a lot of fat in their body that effects teens socially,mentally and physically. If teens stay in the house they eat food provided to them by their parents, also which is healthy and not too oily. Whenever I eat unhealthy food it makes me sick and if you are in place where no one knows you,people there likes tyo stay away from me which makes me feel uncomfortable. I have seen a guy in my family who have grown fat after eating a lot of junk food,he suffers a lot of problems like he need someones help to get up if he sits down,a lot of people teases him for his fatty body and also he cannot even walk fast because he gets tired fast. So to stay away from these bad comments and unfit body teens should eat healthy food and home made food.

Apart from food and sleep curfew for teenagers make them stay home with their families. This makes them to interact with their families instead of going out with friends. Most of times generation gap is being shown in between families that is just because of less attraction in between people in the families. Having dinner together at night makes you discuss various aspects going on around us. Like when our family get together we talk about of new things we tried,just as me and my sister made new friends as we shifted here this year. Also we talk about how to be aware from diseases going on in recent days. We also discuss about problem we are suffering from. This makes us share our happiness and problems we are going through in our life and also we are able to intract wih the family members.

There are various more ideas that shows that this adoption takes teens lives towards positive aspects. Proper sleep,healthy food and interaction with their families can be obtained if this curfews are adopted. To make future generation healthy and concentrated about development and growth of our country these laws are need to be applied. If teens will be healthy they will come up as fresh and present minded citizens towards the country. If they will sleep well,they will work hard to make their dreams come true. Also if they will interact with their families they will make each and every one satisfied in world. Teens should take this in a positive way instead of taking it as a restriction on their freedom. This is not a reastriction but a key to live healthy,fresh and active way of life. Give teens life by restricting their habits instead of giving them dealth with improper lifestyle.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5

0F7900292BB6,"Have you event been told that you had to chose a career before high school. I have, and I say we as young adult should pace ourselfs and not rush this important life decision so early. Because that decision de the person and the time, not important for take one career. Each young person has a decision to purse a career or not because it is optional.

First of all I disagree whit this idea, because young students are more like to listen what adults tell them to chose. That ends up on kinds chosen careers they dont want or like and in the long run it takes away their Dreams, money, and time. The kinds need more inspiration for that in future they take one career like: doctor, arquitec, teacher, and other carriers is good have one inspiration. Is good have persons that support in every time like Mom, family or dad. Because much young not listen the adult or not have support in the family for that reason they do not pursue a career.

Secondly us young adults need to expand our knowledge in the work field. Like for example we need to watch videos and have people already working their to explain How they work and ward they do. It would be a good idea to have two examples of people: a person who has ready finished his career and has work and money and the other, who does not finish his studies and asks for money in the street. Is good what a young thing in her future the difficult is life outside working in the hot or cold not is nathing essy.

Everybody have that thing in her future, on good future for the family, wife, sons, daughter. Is good have idea in the High school that like you. Because you like draw you take the career arquitec is good idea. The people inspired draw like building, the natural place everything is good. The people like arquitec to created building in Dubai is very nice I don't no but is beautiful in only imagination. Much person no have idea the important is the study in the life.

E3096B04916A,"Nowadays many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. There is a debate if school should or should not control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that students should be more involve in extracurricular activities. However, I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because students will have to much pressure on their shoulders, students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study, and students have to work.

One reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will have to much pressure on their shoulders. They will be always worrying about school stuff and the fact that they have to spend a lot of time in extracurricular activities. Spending to much time on extracurricular activities can led students to a depression. They will not get enough rest because of not doing anything else ,but extracurricular activities. Students will get tired that they would not want to do anything else. Students

Another reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study. Students will have little time to study for a test or quiz. Evidently, not having enough time to study can led students to fail their classes. Students will not turn homework or projects on time. Students deserve to have extra time to study.

Final reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students have to work. Students work to be independent. Students work to pay for their future education. Students work to help their families financial. Students work to achieve their future goals. They work to not have a miserable life in their future. Work will give them more opportunities in their life.

To conclude, for these reasons and so many more is why I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families. Students will have a lot of pressure, students will have lack of time to study or finish with their homework, and students got a job. Schools should think a little bit more about student's responsibility and how controlling students involvement extracurricular will impact their life. I know that the education is very important ,but student deserve to make their own decisions. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

5AFBB5573AB3,"Have you ever just sat at home all day and used your phone? Oder food or play games and Facetime friends? being on technology doesnt help you make friends or help you get out of the house.

Some people say its a negative effect on people because all they do is use their phone when they need something, instead of going out getting fresh air or hanging out with friends. People that are constantly on their phones can cause them depression, because all they do is sit at home, and the phone provides them everything. it can also draw you away from friends and can be a distraction at school

It also can be a positive effect because you get to text your friends, for example example if a friend moved out of state you would still have contact with them. its also easier to do homework, or you can read a book online instead of going to the library and getting one.

""Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others"" in that quote it says that you can finish a task without having contacts with people, how is someone suppose to have social contacts with people? how do you learn new things or new meet people? Thats why technology can be bad for someone people.

For example when I'm on my phone all day cause i'm sick or stayed home from school I get bored being on my phone all day, yes the phone is useful but it doesnt help staying in your room all day watching a movie or a show, you dont get to learn anything. Talking to people and having social contact is sometimes better, you learn a new word or a new fact each day, but theres some negatives in all of it, you can lose close friends because you get distracted on your phone and you dont listen to what they have to say.

Theres a lot to do beside staying at home and being on your phone, you can go out and get lunch with friends instead of sitting at home and eating alone. I know a few people that don't have many friends, so they are usually on their phones a lot, you can see the difference, people that are on their phone a lot and just sit at home don't really know how to act in public. People sometimes dont like going out and trying new things because they got used to being on their phones.

In conclusion technology is a negative effect on people because it doesnt allow them to see whats outside of their phones. They tend to just use their phones when sometime its better if they talk to their friends in person. Using your phone can take you away from your friends and it isnt a good thing.

CD9FDD5F9F9E,"Does failure play a big role in success? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although failure often just ends up in failure, I agree with Winston Churchill's statement that failure can lead to success if people continue to use enthusiasm.

First of all, many of our inventions used today are a result of failures.

For example, Edison created the lightbulb, but failed many times before he discovered electricity.

He used his faith and motivation to not give up and keep trying even though he had many set backs.

He accidently made a circular shaped like glass ball which became a source of electricity. If Edison did not keep trying, we would not have electricity today. Also, many scientists have created medicines after many failed attempts.

For instance, there is now a chicken pox shot that prevents people from getting the chicken pox.

Through many experiements with mixure of chemicals and failed trials, scientists were eventually able to find a shot that prevents chicken pox from entering your system. These examples show that failures often lead to success if people never give up trying.

Second of all, many students have failed in school, but if they keep trying and keep their enthusiam, they will succeed. For example, I have had a hard time in school, especially with passing my sol's. When time goes on, I try harder and harder, and spend more time studying with my teacher.

As of today, I have passed all of the sol's I need in order to graduate except for the one I am writing about right now.

I also have a learning disability and ADHD and have a hard time paying attention and often lose focus in my classes.

Even with my disability, I have not given up and keep coming to school and get extra help from my teachers so that I can graduate this year.

I make sure I follow the rules, don't skip class, or don't miss school becuase it's so hard for me to make up what I miss. Although many seniors like to skip class, I do not skip becuase I want to earn a high school diploma. Even in education, there are failures, but through hard work and a good attitude, students can succeed.

In conclusion, I agree with Chruchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of entusiasm.""

Even though people will experience failures, there will be success if they work hard, keep the enthusiiasm, and never give up. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0
ED6070D470FF,"I despise it when someone your close to says ""you can't be like me you have to be better than that."" What right do you have to speak on what I have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? This is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. Like people always say ""you are who you hang around with."" For example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. A man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior.

Being a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. For example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriend's baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? Be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. This is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. When you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because that's all you ever known growing up. So staying away from words that can't be used in a school or around familly is your best bet.

A celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. People of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. When a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then they're praised for it. They attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. For teenagers this is who decides for them if they'll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. Teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now.

No mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody. That is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. Do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. However some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a person's behavior. Showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are exiting your mouth. No one would want their own kid to be effected by a bad role model.      ",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.0

Hello I hope you doing well, my name is Generic_Name. The present letter is to let you now that I'm fascinating of your business management, and I'll be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, indagate, and discover about distintic occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropiated place of my interest to work at.

In fact, I can learn about the resposability and most of the times the presure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future.

To adapt in differents positions and the most imporatnt thing is to love what I would do, to be an applicated, and apassionated person in the place that I would like.

Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many different places that they wanted, couldn't achive their goal or may be the postion that they wanted was alredy taken by someone else.

The resposability at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesn't have the resposability in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for.

I would like to be the person who has the responsability and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things.

Althought, I can learn day by day how to impprove without an advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area. Many people think that work is only to get money, and bored and they are there just because they need to pay their bills, the main reason of work is to love what you like and enjoy doing it.

Most of it is caused by teenagers because they do not know between what is right and what is wrong. teens around the world resolved to violence, affecting others around them. Most of it is caused by bullying. Years ago the government allowed students to attend online courses and a good amount of students left high school and stayed to take online courses.

Students should attend online courses because bullying would decrease nand it would be easier to find your way through the website instead of walking from class to class.

Bullying would have a major decrease because students would be at home instead of school. Everyday students get harassed by other students and then up to the point where it drives them to commit suicide. Students would be at their house where it's safe and less distracting. Also, some students are too shy to be around other people so they get bullied for it. Every parent doesn't want to see their kid get bullied. There so much negativity being spread around and it not only affects the victims life it also affects their families.

It would be easier to find your way through online courses instead of walking class to class. It could be difficult for some students to find their way around the school because of how big it might be. With only the press of a few buttons, students would easily find their way towards their next assignment.

Others may think that taking online courses are a waste of time. Parents question the school district ""

if we have teachers then why do we need online courses?"".

Some students would feel a bit depressed knowing that all their friends are at school and they are the only ones at home looking at a monitor.

2265CC4410DE,"Changing the lunches to healthier lunches will effect more then just the cafeterias. It will change how people eat, and changing the food habits which is not good. Some adults and parents might love the change, but as teens it might have to be a nightmare. People having favorite lunches and enjoying what they buy to eat should be the goal. Not having to be inforced to eat healthy food on a daily. The school board should speak, and see all the possible outcomes of this change before making a desicion.

Think of how many kids won't eat anymore, because of this change. Losing some of their favorite foods would change everything. Not only a loss for the kids, but a loss for the school as well. Losing more money as more kids stop buying lunch. This could not only effect the stomach's of the people not eating, but could also effect their learning and how they do in school. Nutrition is a big thing in school, because you need it in your system to function.

Habits are also being changed. Being enforced to bring food from the outside. Some people would probably even leave school. That should be one of the schools biggest fears. They are legally in charge of you at schoool, and if you decide to leave, and something happens to you; that can not be good for the school. There are so many things that could fall into this. People coming in and out of the school with food for others. Random people could indentify as a student due to holding a backpack and having food in their hands, so a student opens a door for them.

Some parents are obviously going to disagree. They want their kid or kids to eat, and do well in school. The amount of complaining will be very untolerable and annoying. There should just be a balance between healthy and unhealthy. For example one line could be serving healthy food, and the other could be serving what they used to be serving. They should be making it work instead of making them unhappy.

I really think everything should be looked over again. Making big time decisions like this could really effect the school. I think many people should have a say in this including high representative students, and very exclusive clubs. Some being National Honor Society, Key Club, and maybe even the the county board itself.

F22B25257E47,"Two minds think better than one. Working with someone else can bring many benefits and opportunities to everyone, but there is many people who prefer to work by their self . working in a group can help to have done everything on time, and we can establish a good environment in the classroom. Each person have different opinions, and we have to respect it.

Working in groups help to have everything done on time, since we are gathering many types of ideas and information from everyone. For example, in USA there are a diversity of people from different parts around the world, and each person have a different opinions and ideas in how they see everything. However, some people think that they have better opinions about what they are doing than others, but an opinion or idea is just a help that can guide to the best option. Having groups in classes is a help that can benefit. Because, they are helping each other. When someone is working alone can be struggling and do not ask for any type of help to keep going and make things nicely.

When we are working in groups, we can establish a good environment with our classmates, since there is a lot of communication between classmates. For example, if we work alone, we would not be able to communicate each other, because, everyone is concentrate in what are they doing. Otherwise, people from different parts of the country would not have the opportunities to meet each other and learn different cultures from their classmates. Knowing each other can create a calm and gradable place to stay and share with every student in the classroom. Even other students would prefer to be there.

Many people would like to be in a place where they can share and work together. But many people are looking where they can work with people from different types of cultures and listen every idea or opinions in life. having someone to work with, can make evening easier than working alone.

3E7DE9C1C160,"What lesson would you chose to teach elementary school students? Would you chose math because they like numbers, or science because they like playing with science experiments. I would chose science, because we use science every day by turning on a light, to throwing a ball up in the air. Another reason many students like science is because it is the most fun, by that I mean by all the experiments we do in science. One lesson I would like to teach elementary school students is about science because it is fun, it is the most easiest subject to teach, and it is the most used in daily life.

Firstly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is fun to most adults and kids. First, science is fun because you get to do different types of experiments. For example, If you want to learn about kinetic and potential energy you can use science experiments that have kinetic and potential energy in them. Some experiments can have you involved in throwing a ball so you can illustrate kinetic and potential energy. Second, science is fun because everybody can enjoy it.

For example, say one student does an experiment everyone in the class can experience it because they all witnessed it. Lastly, science is the most fun to make a lesson about because it involves you talking to other people and sharing your observations. For example, If you did a egg drop experiment, you will compare your results to different types of students in your school and hopefully learn from what you did wrong or the opposite. Therefore, science is fun because you get to deal with experiments.

Secondly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is the most easiest to teach to many students and adults. First, science is the most easiest because it does not require you to memorize or remember something every single time. For example in other subjects unlike science you have to memorize the root words for English, or memorize the formulas for math, But here all you have to do is memorize the terminology and you should be good to go. Another reason why science is the easiest is because it is involves experiments which are not hard to understand all it requires you to do it pay attention. For example, If you pay attention to the experiment then you will know every bit of it, But in math you have to keep on practicing again and again until you get it. Third, science is the most easiest to many students because it involves drawing pictures which is the most easiest way to understand something other than memorizing. For example, say that the students don't get it by words so, what you can do is illustrate for them so they get what you are trying to say. This works best in science because because science is the subject that involves the most of drawing and experimenting. So at last, science is the best subject to teach about because it is the most easiest to understand.

Thirdly, I would like to create a lesson about science because it is most used in daily life. Firstly, it is most used in daily life because everything can relate to science. For example, it can be related to light because light can cause radiation, it can be related to the air conditioning because it involves air traveling in currents. All of these thing are related to science and there is certainly more. Secondly, Science can help you understand more of your daily life by performing a lesson. For example, say that you don't know how to use a compass, science can tell you the answer to that because it relates to the magnetic field. Last, science is the most used in daily life for fixing things and being able to understand how things work. For example, science can tell us a lot of information, some examples can be how does a circuit work, how do fix a circuit, how does a light turn on so fast, or other possible things too. In addition, science should be the lesson because it is the most used in real life.

In conclusion, one lesson I would like to teach in elementary school is science because it is the most fun and makes a lot of students smile when they do science, it is the most easiest to teach because it involves minimum talking but a lot of drawing, and lastly it is the most frequently used in real life. So therefore, I should get my science lesson ready for the elementary school students soon because they would have the most fun in this while learning. Would you teach science why or why not?             ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5
DBE977177080,"Have you ever found something on the ground and picked it up and pretended that is was yours.

That right there is called a lie and its really bad because you dont know if that money you found or that toy you found was somebod's when they come back to look for it its gone because somebody else just walked away with there stuff that they spent there money on. When I was a kid I would always see this stuff, people would drop there stuff and I would pick it up and give it back to them or tell them they dropped it and hand it over to them. Usually when people find stuff just laying around the first thing to come to mind is take it but that isnt very smart because you never know whos it is or where it came from, and taking if its not your is stealing. Many people say leave it where you found it because people will comeback looking for there stuff, because nobody leaves there stuff somewhere and then just walks away with out knowing or caring. I know many schools teach this because when I was at my elementary school there would always be signs all over the place talking about leave it where you found it and dont take whats not yours, many kids listened to that in my school but sometimes people just dont care and thats not okay because they might not even need it and just want it. Needing it is like you have to have something or its really important to you and if you dont have it you would have to struggle to find, but if you really need something then I am pretty sure you can buy it from any nearby stores. Wanting something is like you dont have to have it but you just want it to brag or to have fun with it or you just dont really care and dont need it but just want to take something that you can buy, even though your not struggling or going through any trouble you just felt like doing the action you did and dont really care.

If you find something dont take it

If you see somebody drop something give it back to them

Be aware of your actions

Dont listen to pear pressure

Be helpful

Be kind

This lesson is very important because many people now dont do this stuff and just take and many parent dont really care anymore so thats when the school has to step in and teach the young kids whats wrong and whats right. When somebody drops something always hand it back why you say, because if you drop something and you think you lost it and it was your favorite toy or a toy that you spent your money on and really liked it, what if somebody just saw it and took it how would you feel, probably mad, sad,upset, you would be very upset because your favorite toy is gone and you cant get it back because the person that took it does not really care and didnt need it but just wanted it or took it because there was nobody there. Now imagine you drop your favorite toy and somebody saw you drop it and ran up to you to give it back to you how would you feel, probably happy, proud, delighted, because that person gave it back and didnt have any intentions with it or didnt think about even taking it they just wanted to give it back because they are not the owners of the item that was found on the ground but the owner that dropped it is right in front of them, the owner of the item could of just walked away and never realized they dropped it until they needed to use it for something. I lost my iPad years ago because the person that saw it took it and didnt really care do I know who it is no because I never payed attention to who took it I just was really happy and didnt realize what they were gonna do, and didnt think of this stuff happening to me when it did happen I was very upset and had to use my moms phone until my dad would buy me a phone. Thats why this lesson is very important to show kids that taking something that isnt yours is not smart or needed, many people dont care but when it happens to them they care and ask there self why did this happen to me is because you didnt leave what you took where it was found so the person that saw the item you own they did the same thing you just did, they took it and you will probably never see it again. Many items are very expensive like phones people love there phones and can never get off it and when somebody cracks there phone they go nuts and get mad because that crack can make your phone glitch or tweak, but if somebody lost there phone I already know that they would be so mad because nowadays phones are over $1,000 and they can be more expensive then that so when they lose there phone and find out somebody took it they wouldnt be very happy and probably go every where to look for it and would do anything to get it back, because phones are so important to people and sometimes they need it for calling somebody to pick them up or they would be stuck at a place for a long time or to call for help if somebody needs it. If somebody stole my phone I would get very angry and sad because the item I just lost and somebody picked it up or stole it is very expensive and isnt easy to buy because new phones are like the cost of a used car that you can buy from the internet.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
87A8B315A26E,"I think ""taking online class is not a good idea and it, doesn't have any benefit for students"". Some of students asking for online class they think ""we can do it, but it is not too easy"". I used to have online class, and

""in my opinion online class is very hard""

. And doesn't have benefit. when there is no teacher in class to help students, and some of students are too lazy. they need some body to pust them in class.

in,

june 7,2017. I took my online class. And i was new in USA. That was really hard for me, because i was new here and, i didn't know. How i need to do my works? So that wasn't fun. And i didn't get any thing from that class. Because the class was boring for me and very day works became alot so, unfortunately i drop my class. It is very different; when we are in normal class or we are in online class. Because in normal class, there is a teacher, students and a lots of things to they can make class very easy for students. And have a lots of benenfits, but in online class there is noting of these stuff are in online class. And some times online class make students to skip

, because when they face to face with a problom. They can not ask from online class, teacher direct that make students to skip the class, and make the class boring for students, that is what happend with me. And some times student can not have good attend in class, and that can make student to drop the class.

As wall as online class and conferencing class are the hardest classes. But nothing is impossible in this life we can do it "" with hard work and with a good attend in our class"". If i need to take online class in future. I will always try to have communication with my teacher. Because teacher is the only person to can help the student on that class.                                                ",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0
C2E3AD707EDC,"I have the idea that our school should adoptep this model that consist in extending the school day two hours. This model come from a system of some businesses have adopted to conserve energy and resources, this model can help student get more involvev in their apprenticesship and school's activities.

This idea can help stueden but it have disadvantages is well, because there will be some students that will take a lot of time to be in the habit because they were accustomed to the normal school day. Also some students have to work after school, this meas if they stay at the school more time, it will less time that they will have to make work's hours, but this dosen't affect them to much, because they will attend to the school only four day in a week. This is graet because they will have a long weeked to make their tasks and work and help their parents at home with the home's jod. One reasons why our school should follow this model is the creations of new classes like: workshop , drama, and stodios of art . Student can be involvev in every kind of activity to spend their time in something that will help them in their future. Everyone can join up to any program at the school like ORTC this is a great program for some student that are thinking about join up to some militar's branchs, as we know the military can give you many benefits really good, with this program they will get a rich knowledge about it.

Many peoples will disagree with this new model of extending the school day two hours because some of them dosen't like the school already. Also some parents can be disagree because they think that the students doesn't need that much time at the school that's why the school should make a specific schedule, addding more breaks and activities and then, they will realize that this model of extending the school day two hour will be good, and then student will take advantage of time that they will have to learn more.

In example we have a groups of society as we know like some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources. That way the worker have a extra day that can be spend with another work and they are available to have a second jod. This can help them get a better financial life or take that extra time to esped it with their families. In conclusion there are many reason and caress why our school should adopted this model of expending the school day two hours more .

First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now.

People would learn in better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesn't understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesn't talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better.

People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didn't know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasn't good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he would't get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesn't have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes.

The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world would'n be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesn't know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they don't have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they don't even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as it's today, everything would be in peace.

In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. Also, if someone doesn't know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him. Finally, life would be better and easier if everyone talk to an expert what is going on, so nobody would do a big mistake.           ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5
87AF2FEABA83,"Some schools thinks that students should attend classes at home. Others might think that attending classes at school will give benefits to the students. Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more subjects than online classes. If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school.

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn. Attending classes at school as you can see will benefit the student..

In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online. Plus, the students needs to build a relationship with the teacher and staffs. Online classes would not teach a student face to face, It would be better If a teacher teaches the student face to face. As a result, there should be teachers and staff at the school, If the student takes classes at the school. Plus, the students will get a better education.

Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school. People think that online classes will give the student benefits. They also think that the benefit of taking online classes, is to give the students more opportunity to learn. In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects. If a student takes classes in school they will have the opportunity to learn much better.

Therefore, students should take classes in school. Schools are meant to be for students to learn from all subjects. Taking classes in school would benefit the students.

0E07647BBC59,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home ?

Well school is a place your suppose to feel comfortable in, there are many different schools. I personally think being home schooled can have it's advantages and disadvantage, you of course have benefits for example not being bothered by other classmates, and finishing your work on time without having a distraction, kids in outiside schools have that disadvantage of having classmates who don't care about there education and some kids get carried away and distracted and they end up having to repeat classes or stay another extra year, It's very different because years on years you can just retake the class at home with nobody judging you about failing, here it is like an embarassment to be seen another year so that's something to look into.

Home schooled kids i would say get more attention as in that one on one attention, I would also say outside schools get the same but there are plenty of full classes and the teacher can't always get around to all students. There are lots of kids who want to be able to attend outside school but they can't for many reasons for example a disability or how they are a celebrity, being in that situation you would want to not be known like that so your just forced and obligated to attend home school and that's when home school kids would think it would be better to be attending outside school you'll always be home and feel trapped you'll get tired of being in your own home, It does people good being able to socialize a bit.

School can also be finished faster during home school, lots of things are offered, but also lots of things are not offered for example lunch, in almost all public schools there is free lunch, free everything your getting a free education, home school is expensive and you will always provide your own food. The wifi at home will also be payed, the computer and just many things but as we know it can be beneficial in life your getting an education so it's worth the spend you'll get something out of it.

What's better than being home and getting an eduacation it's benefitting you and it will in the future, when you get a dipoma. My point is either your in public school, private school, home school, it will benefit you in many many ways. ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0
746A0BFABA84,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why should first impressions defined who you are? Why are they so ""impossible"" to change? are first impressions really that important, why should something so small change the way you think about someone. First, no one is perfect. Everyone has very different personalities or ways of being. Second, it should't defined who we are. First impressions don't always go well, you should be able to change that. Finally, It could ruin your reputation. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. To the point that it could be emotionally wrecking

First, no one is perfect. We aren't perfect beings, we all have different personalities. Different things we do that others don't and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. That's when first impressions come to play. Meeting someone for the first time can often be hard to manage since is the first time you are meeting this person. Truly anything could go very wrong. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. Life sometimes will go wrong and we can't change that or let it get the best of us because we aren't perfect and it's okay if sometimes things don't go our way of liking. if it goes bad we should be able to change it or try again.

Second, it should't defined who you are. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way. Sometimes we make mistakes and theres cases where people don't like that. When you are on a stated of mind of anger, you could do something drastic but that doesn't defined who you are on your heart and mind. You have your own mistakes and flaws but that isn't you is just a part of you that doesn't think and does thing on impulse. When you are trying to make everything perfect that person it could stress you out really bad and anything could make you go off. when it's the first time meeting that person it can really tress you out bad but that's okay. First impressions should be able to be change because if that were to happen it could really damage a person if that certain person was important to them. You should be able to reschedule the date when everything is better and you can be normal. If they are truly your friend they will allow to you to that.

Finally, it could ruin your reputation. Let's say you are the most friendly person in your school and everyone likes you because of how fun or nice you are. you would love to keep that way. But one day a new student comes to your school and you introduce yourself but right out of the bat they don't like you without knowing anything about you. That thought could eat you up for the rest of the time, and you try and try to get that person to like you but they don't. Being able to change that first impression is all that you would like to do but it feels impossible. But it isn't impossible if that person wanted to get to know you they could but they don't want to and yes there's people like that all over the world. Having a second chance could change everything for you but we should't let it get the best of us that person will come around at their own time. We can't make people be our friend if they don't want to. If they want to get to know you they will.

Conclusion, First impressions are not important things will go wrong sometimes and that's okay. We can always try again another day, it should't get the best of us or makes us feel some type of way if that person truly wants to be your friend they will not care about the mistakes you make or anything around that. You are human and you make mistakes sometimes. And that's okay, it doesn't defined who you are;only you know who you are on the inside. First impressions should't even be a thing they stress you out and makes you over think. Being able to change the impossible is something we should be able to do always. Don't let anything like that make you think less of you. ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5
E91D1A0039C3,"Sometimes is really hard to get this opportunities. If students get the chance to learn about what they like they should take advantage of it. They might learn things that interested them. Although some students think this opportunities are useless, actually it opens a lot of doors at a young age to learn about the things they like. For some students this is a big privilege. Find out who they are.

A few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. They tend to think that is useless just because they don't have the program they are insterested in. Normally people get use to the things they like, and they don't want to learn new things. Sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits.

Other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. If they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. When kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up. Almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. When they grow up their way of thinking chances. Kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. While others grow with the same mentality. Some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. It does not only happens when they are little. It could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. It might be better than it looks.

Also, If they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. I had a friend, and he really loved psychology. He took the class this year because he thought it could be interesting. Midway through the year he found out that he is not so good at it. Although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. Sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it. They all should have a second plan in case plan A is not working so well. Everyone should be ready just incase there is a rush change, and they have to take a decision in less than a day. They have to hope the best and get ready for the worst.

Some students think this opportunity is lame for not having what they want to learn about. Some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. I classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. I also have two careers in mind. I know if one of them fails me I still have the other one. This is why I should get the opportunity to go. I truly want to know if the careers I have in mind are what I want to do the rest of my life.

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

As the British naturalist and politican Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I certanly agree that everyone is capeable of choosing their own character trait, they are independent enough to have control over themselves', they're capeable to choose in what type of enviroment they want to be in, or how to react to bad or good circumtances, at the end of the day we all have the freedom to choose who, and what we want to be.

Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' everyone have the completly control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumtances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allow to choose either to smile or cry, to be positivee or negative for example;

My grandma, she's a 78 years old lady that have work her entire life, she's a very independent women who always says, ""If i don't do it, no one can make it as good as i can."" Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she have always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances and she never gave up on herself she decided to be ""positive"", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times.

Everyone can have the freedom to choose the enviroment around them, how they wanna live, with who they wanna leave, people have the abilitly to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an enviroment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative enviroment into a positive enviroment, everything in your character depends on your onw person, yes the enviroment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily base, but at the end of the day it alwasy depends on you, who you wanna be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be.

Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can shows them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a really big part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character it's really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but that's like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone have the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be.

In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word agains them, theywill always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will alwaysbe what they choose their character traits to be.

833489139971,"Former British Minister Winston Churchill once said that 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Many people are not perfect and fail, and some think failure is bad. Failure is actually good, because it teaches you what was wrong. Although some people may think that failure does not play a role in success, it should be known that failure dose play a role in success.

One of the reason failure plays a role is that people can learn from their mistake. when people fail they can find out what went wrong instead of giving up, Another reason is failure makes people stronger. A lot of times failure may cause people stress, and stress makes people strong and not give up. Also failure helps people become better people. leaning from there failure.

Although some people think incorrectly that failure do not play a role in success it should be know that it dose play a role in success, because you can lean from your failure, failure makes you stronger, and failure makes you a better person. people should not give up when they fail, they should learn and try again until they succeed.

When those student who want to graduate from high school in three years. they must work hard for their school. and they have to pass a lot of test and SOL. To graduate from high school. then they can go to college.

example;people who are's emigrant,and want to do the three years of high school;they have to work hard.

When student want to do the offer programs three year of high school. i believe they have to work hard. To pass their classes. Also getting good grad for their classes, i believe that they must study hard, and be properer for any test that is coming on. They must pass their classes by receiving good grad. Also to receive a good GPA for their record, Students must attend every day because if they do not do that, it will effect their grad. Then they get behind. from a lot of things.

example, student have to work hard in their classes to receive a better grad.

Student who is taking summer school, and work really hard to graduate from high school. I believe they will have a better future for their life, and their family.

Because student will have the capability in the future to find a good job that they wanted. Also those student will have the capability to go to good college to study will. I believe having a good back round from high school any college will accept those student; Also a good GPA, and those student who want to do three years of high school. Must attend every day to do not get behind from their classes, Because not being at school will effect their grad. Also student must work hard for their graduation.

example, student must go to summer school, and pass those classes that they need;also i believe summer school will very easy.

They offer programs of three years, I believe student must pass their SOL in three years of high school to graduate. student must focus on their school and classes for receiving a better grad. Also i believe there are some student who have to work full time. Also come to school full time, and they are in the three years of high school program. i believe it will be hard for those student who go to school and work after school. there will short time for those student, to study for their lesson from classes. Specially for those student who is emigrant and do not know any thing about they new school. But still they have to work so hard to complete three years of high school. to graduation.

example;student will the opportunity early graduation; if they work hard.

I believe that three years of high school going to be hard for student. But it is a good opportunity for those smart student to graduate early from high school. then they can start their college earlier. because it gave them capability to make up their life Earle.

Let's say I want to see other dementions' worlds', or go back in time. Lets say I build a machine to be able to do that. Cleaning the house, Cooking a meal, and doing homework. If we are always doing, then we can accomplish. We accomplish more by doing something. If we didn't we wouldn't have the things we do now. We can accomplish things' as a team or individually. Like sports, in sports people work together to win. A game company, these people work together to make a game, so that people can play it. In a game people play together online to win as a team or individually. It's better if we do our work, homework, or even little things like play outside, hangout.

Inactivity in it's own way has a purpose resting or sleeping, relaxing. If you do that you let out that steam. We take a break after working hard on something. So we do what we have to do for a couple of hours, we go home, we can take a nap, eat, watch a bit of tv, or sleep. That way the next day you can be motivated to continue doing your job, or go to school. If we do even a little during the day we've accomplished like go out and buy groceries, clean the house, and cook. If you do that then you've accomplished something. you can't really do anything if you sleep all day. Being lazy is not good.

88816FFD8A5C,"Online Learning

Who doesn't want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when they're in their house, students can't have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home.

Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Name's text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher.

Secondly, taking classes online doesn't just mean you don't have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one.

Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You can't always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people aren't perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasn't functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone.

In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.    ",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0
0C28481DFBB8,"In my opinion, I know why Thomas Jefferson decide to wrote this for his people. He want to see if we are responsible with our own work and left to lose the time just little things, he just want that his people can make their dreams. When he wrote this people was scare because their people was slave before

Abraham Lincol become president of the United State. This show three reason why he wrote this.

First, Thomas Jefferson spend his time with us because he want to see how his people really following his wrote. Many people don't think about what they can do in their life, if we still spend time with other people we don't accomplish our own dreams, sometimes people are shy,and scare with their dreams because other people can bother them because they can accomplish their dreams or may be they don't believe in them. Some people can't acommplish their dreams because they think that is lot stuff but the reason is that they never try, if they can accommplish their dreams.

Second, if we look and read carefully we can find more about this wrote. We really can't thinking about because we don't have commitment to make our own dreams better. Some people are in school but they don't see the opportunity that we have for make a lot stuff in the future. We just go at school because our mothers dispatch us at the school. If we used about Thomas Jefferson wrote we can learn how we have work hard for make our life much better. We just have to think just in the our future and study more for have a good grade and accomplish the dreams we wish.

Third, in this time we have much time in our own life for do a lot stuff because we are freedom. But we just think to go out with friend and have fun, nobody care their dreams in this time. They spends their time in party and doing lots stuff with our friends. If we still doing the same things with our friends we never get something better in our own life. We need to have more commitment about what we really want in our future.

In conclusion, we can be better than other people because we are young and we can do more stuff. We can teach them thst we can do all this stuff, if we can think better. We have a good concentration in all what we do. Don't matter what we can accomplish our own dreams because we are not alone we have our familes for support us with really we want to do in the future.

AD175892EC1C,"Attending school and Attending online classes.

Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing is not a really smart idea. You can learn better by making eye contact, and asking questions from the teacher rather, than just trying to learn online. Education is one of the most important things in our life that we can't continue it in a good way by attending online classes. Attending online classes might look a smart idea for some learners because they might be able to stay home, and study, but there is absolutely a reason that we build schools. Students might get benifts by attending online classes, but not as they will by going to school. Attending school instead of attending online classes have a lot of benefits that can change an idea of attending online classes.

Attending school can give us a freindly character by being able to talk in front of a group of people. When we attend school, we start talking, and communicating with people by the time we get in the bus. We can find freinds, and get help from them when we need. We will be able to ask any question from the teacher at any time that we want, and they can give us the answer without waiting or searching it online. We will get ready for bigger communities such as college and university by attending school. Teachers don't just teach us a lesson, but they show us how to talk in a good way, and how to have a good character in our life. which online classes would't help us in such a way. We will have a lot of events at school that we can celebrate with the whole school. We can't celebrate any event while attending online classes.

Our chatacter, and the way we are is really important, and attending school will help us to have them in a best way. Talking, and asking questions in front of the whole class or several classes will help us a lot to get ready for college, and more other presentations. Comunicating is something that we will need to use in every day of our life. School is the best way to learn how to comunicate. When we go to college or university there will be a community bigger than a school. Therefore, attending school is a very good option rather than attending online classes. School is not just a place to study books, but its a place where we learn how to live like an educated human. Friends are like family. while we are attending school we will make a lot of freinds but we can't make any freind while attending online classes. Celebrating some events will give us the best memory while we can have that by attending school but not online classes.

Attending online classes have a lot of disabilities to teach a student they way they need to be teaching. A teacher can show us how to use a good language with other people but an online class wouldn't be able to do that. A big community like school can make us get used to talk in front of a group of people, while in online classes we are alone. We need courage in order to study. When we answer a question in the class or get a good grade in our class, the teacher, and students courage us but if we get a good grade in online class, there is no one to see our talent and courage us wihtout a small class massege. Attending online class might be good for some reasons. When we are sick or we have a poblem that we can't go to school; attending online class will help us, but not for a long time. Video conferencig has a big different with wactching what the teacher does in class, and what questions students ask.

There is a lot of ways that we can study but, attending school is the best way. Attending school is a complete education than other ways. we build schools because we can understand the importance of studying at school. School is a place where we start how to to earn someting that we want, and teachers help us with that by giving us courage. Attending online classes will just help us read something, and if we don't understand a word, then we need to search online for that either, whcih is going to take longer time than studying at school. I strongly prefer attending school than attending online classes because there are many benifits we can get by attenidg school rather than attending online classes. We can not learn all the good things on online classes that we can by attending school. Attending online classes will be a big process, diffuicult, less apportunties, and there is no one to encourage us or show us what is good for us. Attending school is a best way to have a bright future, a good way to communicate and a good preperation for college and bigger communities.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0
EFF1803E4B81,"Why are people scared to fail? Is failing really a bad thing. NO! For example Churhcill says that ""success consists of going from failiure to faliure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him. I believe that to have success in life you have to go through failiure. Failing with the same feelings and mindset is hard but you just have to think failing is a way of getting better. Failiure is also not something you should be afraid of or embarressed of. You should be proud of failing cuz you know what you did wrong and next time make it twice as strong. Failing does not mean that your to dumb to do whatever it is. It just means you need some more time. Churchill bleieves that failure has an important role in the pursuit of success. Which I also believe this becuase once you fall all you want to do is get right back up. Which I encourage everyone to do.

When you fall get back up everyone falls. Life is about taking risks and failing. Which in my opinion evryone should do. Failiure is the key to success. Without failing you can't really call it success. I beleive you can only succeed in something that you have failed at. Without failing life would be boring and everything would be the same because people are taking riks we have lots of different things in the world today. Everyone has failed to do something. Not everyone in the world is perfect. I wrote this to persuade my readers to take risks. It is also fine to fail just get up and try again. Surely, if Churchill was a live today her would be spreading the same message around the world. That without failiure there is no success. Also, that everyone has failed at something, nobodies perfect.

Churchill Is trying to say that faliure turns in to success. Once you fail you know what you have to do to get yourself back up. Then you try again and again until you get something you are happy with. This is what makes you try again. This is what makes you find and fix your problems. You get a lot out of failing thats why i think that anyone that is going through something tough don't give up so easily becuase its is ok to fail. Failing is a good thing not a bad. However, its hard for people to think in this way becuase they think once they fail its all over. Its not over until you want it to be over. Keep trying and Try your hardest.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
A38A3B76558A,"Nowadays, the majority of students in high schools do not think about their future for many factors: time, dedication, or buget. Schools are a very important tools to help students to realize how important is to to commit to a career at a young age, because It is something that will help them for their future. It is a good idea for many reasons: prepares students as a future adults, keep them focus in their goals, and It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them.

One important reason, is to prepare students as a future adults, because each person has a responsibility as an adult, and this a good skill for each student to learn and built a knowledge when they get to the point of being an adult. For example, at a young age like teenagers in high school are able to absorb new ideas and words everyday to built their knowledge, and have the ability to apply it in the future for their career. This is really important, because this will help to molding them as a future adults for the society.

Also, It is a good idea to for students to commit to a career at a young age, because It keeps them focus in their goals. By selecting a career at a young age, students can be focus on what they want or what do they need to achieve it. For example, schools can provide vital information about the career students may select, depending on the course they like. How much is it cost, how long it may take, and do they need to know about the career. This is really important, and it can motivate students to follow their dreams, and strive to achieve their goals.

In addition, It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. Each person needs the time to know what could be the ideal career or job in order to keep foward. For example, if a student is in his or her first year of high school and she or he wanted to be a doctor, but it realized that now he or she wants to be a teacher. The student still has the chance to change its mind and can choose the career of becoming a teacher. That is why is really important to have the time to think about a career at a young age.

In conclusion, commiting a career at a young age is really important, because it can help people focus in what they want to be. At a young age, shows the level of mindset of each person, and who wants to be succesful in life. Starting from a young age does not mean people have a final desicion, but it may be an idea in general that everybody should practice at a young age to not have struggles in future decisions, and it would be more easy to choose a specific career.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0

When the movie finished you realize is already late, and that you need to go home to get the basketball uniform and your water. Ten blocks away your house you realize that the traffic is getting for ever, you feel like is never going to end,

that the minutes passed so slowly, really nervous, and sweaty. When you get home and check the clock you see you have just twenty minutes to get ready and go to school, your mom is screaming at you really angry because she is always telling me to be responsible. You arrived your team is already playing without you. Since you get there late Generic_Name tells, ""You are not going to play today, because you are not responsible."" I think a good lesson I can teach to the kids is responsibility at home, school projects, and sports.

First, responsibility at home is really important because is were we live, and when you are responsible you show respect to your parents. One day my best friend Generic_Name called me because she wanted to get a coffee and tell me she was really nervous of failing the year because she have not been responsible. I told her, ""I am going to ask my mom."" When i asked my mom she told me really angry, ""Have you fix your room and wash the dishes?"" I respond, ""I have fixed my room, but I have not washed the dishes."" I supposed that she was angry so that was an no. I tell

Generic_Name I cannot go, and she was really sad about it. Later I realized that I was not responsible about doing my duties at home. That is why you need to be responsible of doing your duties at home.

Next, you need to be responsible with school projects because in this way you get better grades. When I was in elementary school I remember I need to do a science project for the science fair. I wanted to get the first place of all the school cause I knew that i will feel really happy of it. I decided to do a wave experiment, but it was really complex and i knew it would take a long time to do it. I collect all the materials and build it, but i did not remember about the poster. The poster need to be really big and with the hypothesis, procedure,

materials, results, and pictures. I did not make my best work in that poster, so I get i ninety percent and third place. I feel really good about the results, but I learn that in order to be better we need to be responsible at school.

Finally, responsibility at sports. I did not know we needed to be responsible when practicing any sport. Just imagine you have the last soccer game of the year. Generic_Name have told you many times the directions of what you need to do all the week before the game, but you have not follow them correctly. One of the directions was eat healthy, but you have been eating pizza all the week. Other direction was drink a lot of water every day, but instead of drinking water you drink soda. The day of the game has came, and you did not get prepared because you did not wanted to be responsible. When you are at the middle of the game you start to feel really dizzy. Generic_Name and the nurse take you out, and tell you why are you so ill. In sports you need to be responsible of your health.

Responsibility is what make us be better. In think responsibility help us have a better place to live. I list three ways we can show we are responsible. To show the importance of it. Ways we can show we are responsible are making duties at home, at school, and practicing any sport.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

For example I met my best friend other friend, the first time I saw her other friend I instantly like her. She was so sweet always giving me a good energy that I want for a person. She was so kind and love to smile, and she dress neatly. Her smile effect me she makes want to me smile, from that moment on I know that her and I could get a long.

Another example my seatmate, my first impression about him was a good one. Because he was just calm and his attitude is the same as mine. I see myself in him, him and I just get along well and his giving a good energy that I like for a person.

Another example first day of our club meeting, my club teacher paired me to someone that I don't know, For us to know who are other club members are to know each other. My first impression about her was not good, because she did not talk to me when I tried to talk to her. She gives me a bad energy that I don't like to a person.

Some people might disagree with me that first impressions are almost impossible to change, and some people might agree with me. I agree, because first impression are important to me it helps me to know instantly if I like the person that I just met or not. Some people might say or think that first impression does not matter, because you should know the person you just met more. Before you decide that when ever you like that person or not. And I would agree to that, but for me first impression are almost impossible to change, for my own opinion.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5

In high school to ca be graduate and learn how the new life is in here, and learn a lot of things to adapted or to fit to the new language and the new people what did I say new here is another world, new people new language that is why I'm here, I came from to my native country. To learn English and speak like a normal person like I speak Spanish, speak bout same without of problems. I'm going to take position on myself to spoken in this introduction, things did i most enjoy in high school is having the opportunity to study here in the United State. And also learn a new language I'm so thanks full for all those opportunities.

All of the things did happen on my life was not easy, and also I remember when my cousin speak English like a normal language and he also came from where came from and i remember did i said i want to spoke like you i was so impressed and how he can speak English like a normal person here in the U.S, because in that time I did not any English at all. When was my time to get in high school begin all this things did i was want for a long time. first day I was so nerviest but at the same time exerted because I came in with my mind in what I'm want and what I love was and is learn English and spoke like normal.

Generic_School give the opportunity at the students graduate on three years, except at the normal traditional four, let me tell you why I take three years except at the normal four cause my age I'm almost getting on (21) at the date to graduate for example, if I'm taking the four years of high school when the people have more then 21, they kicking you off the school

In addition all what has to happen to can be graduate is taking all of the classes did I need it to get the credits. making or taking classes on summer school maybe night school to graduate on time is hard process to graduate in three year but helps a lot to the people who work after school or another thing that probably they has to do, to graduate without credits missing. And here I am in my last year of high school I'm a senior I feel good can be say this is my last year here and all this help me for the program what they made for us to graduate in three years that helps me at all.

For example giving hand and talk about what they can do. The minister Winston, had the responsibility to help others around he, and give enthusiasm to what they can do and how far they can go.

Them Let's say on my class my teacher ask to work with others I had to work and show up. For example: let's talk about work in group,help each other giving ideas to we can add on the project. The terms was tried if you fails show up and do cause there is how you can be better. If you make a mistake no problem on other time you can do more better on my opinion there is how the minister can work.

In addition there the things can Minister Winston do was talk about with others if they be agree. Because if they do not be agree with the statement was cause they had to know that and see is the achievement work successful too.

Now I take the my position on my opinion many people like me came to this country and looking for better opportunities to we don't have in our country. Also we had to learn the languages what is hard but we tried to what we can do and show up how we can be better on the future.

But many student had a long history or someone didn't graduated cause many student had to pay rent or thing to what's hard to work after school and don't have to much time to sleep, any ways we had to work hard.

Also many student show what they can do and how far they can go, Also many emigrant people came here to found a safe place to live so the mind on our country we don't many security.

For example if you read a book like 20 minutes you learn and know how to pronounce that work that help you to main ten your vocabulary an read faster.

I'm a student who like to help others and like to share new ideas with other and talk about what we want to on a future. a couples of thing I want to share are : thanks the program for help us and the teacher who help us with new things everyday.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0
10D2D1173D36,"Should schools have partnerships with companies? There are two sides whom chose one of the two alternative choices. Considering the topic is about students pursuing a type of job, its safe to assume that schools should have partnership with companies.

However, the opposition overlooks an important view, namely that since there are students who wouldn't be interested in the slightest, there would be some that are intrigued. If schools didn't have a partnership with a company then students wouldn't have been able to find their future jobs.

Due to this, students would have found a job they like. They wouldn't have any difficulties searching for a job if school had partnership. By working at a job they really like, it'll be easy for them to finish through any work they have.

With the partnership, students, who found an employment they like, can work at their dream job. They'll be able to success through their careers.

In conclusion, schools should have a partnership with a company. That way students can be able to have a job they're good at.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

The students and teachers can get more a free dar, that day we can take sleep, study for other you need study someting, enjoy with your family, develop your self and what do I want to do. I can have many good someting for you. But the other days, you have the school day two more hours. You need think about now. We have seven hour on school, you dose not tired for long times in school? The seven hour is very long time,

every early morning all students wake up the may de am 5:30 or 6:00, you need take prepare to go to school, and stay there for seven hour. But if we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours, you should loss the two hours from many something. For example, I can't have a sleep, study for you need know someting, enjoy with my family, develop my self, and what do I want to do.

DD00E48BC258,"Honestly, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The pursuit of success in life is achieving it in many ways.. Therefore, you can push yourself to be successful by putting in effort.. Failure can lead to serious conflict because then you will not be able to succeed. The important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success is not agreeable because you can overcome obstacles, aiming the goal to success, and to achieve the plan to .success.

First reason, is to overcome the obstacles, for that you must have to work hard. Also, it takes practice the better you get to succeed. Do not give up on something you are overcoming in life. One of the biggest problems that people have in life is not overcoming what they are afraid of and from being afraid will not get you to succeed. Most of all to overcome the obstacles. is to try them not to give up on them.

Second reason, putting a great effort can lead to improving. Efficiently the work you do can increase a great impact towards your achievements. In order to achieve a method, working pays off and by earning it. For example, people push themselves to making progress. Others might work hard in different ways to be successful and to aim what they want. Eventually, when making progress towards something, can influence the goal your improving.

Third reason, to plan the success is to try achieving what your aiming for. In other words, enthusiasm can be those people that want to be successful in life. Pursuit also aims for the goal your trying to influence. When planning goals, is the most valuable thing to achieve. There must always be a plan towards the target you aim. Majority of the people, look for something easy they can achieve in their future goal and that is how they succeed.

Finally, the key to being successful in life is by achieving it. To be honest, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of improving. Many people find success by putting in effort and time towards big things. It is not to late to start pushing yourself to be successful and being something in life. Therefore, is it not an important role that failure plays in pursuit of success, and to achieve the plan to succeed ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.5
2C94D8BCF2F9,"How can we judge a person without know that person?

In the world there is many people different races,different social levels but everyone on this society is the same.

The people can be really nice if you take the time to know them.

When a person take enough time to know you and try to make a god relationship with you it would change what he or she thinks about you it can change his perspective about you, Some societies judge you because dont Know what kind of people you are and that is because those society dont take the time to look your personality they look at your society conditions and that is bad because it doesnt describe you. In addition if a person is at the lowest point of the society we dont have to judge how munch money they have we got to analyze his personality.

An example of this is like when somebody get into a store and that person is not wearing clean and good stuffs we dont have to say that person is a drug addicted maybe that person came from his work to buy something for wife that is something that we got to think.

The society can not classify anybody or generalize .

All the people has different kinds of mind some people say that the poor people is not educated that they are animals just because they heard something bad about them. That is wrong because all the people is not the same as god people is on this world, bad people is too maybe because somebody did a bad action all that kind of his people is bad too everyone is responsible by his own actions.

An example of this is like when a Mexican make a mistake doesnt mean that all the Mexicans are bad, that action says that he was bad but not everyone was bad.

Another big example is Generic_School in this school there is many Hispanic people as i, just because a person did something bad doesnt mean that all the Hispanic people does that too.

If we help we can change a bad perspective about a person.

All the people always got his own problems, some people is going throw bad moment, because we are humans we are not machines that make everything perfect.

an example is like when somebody had a bad day and you see that person by the first time in your life then that person do something wrong we can not say that person is a dumb just because he made a mistake we can not say that about somebody else, we can help that person talk with that person and provide our to the person who need it that will help to change our perspective and success as a person.

All the people has to have a second chance.

The society that we are is a society comprehensive where you as person can make everything possible, you give a second impression about yourself even if you did a person that gave a bad first impressions.

An example of this is when a person go out from the jail(everybody says that the people that come from the jail gonna be bad but i don think so,maybe that person went to the jail because he made a big mistake thats bad yes)and that person try to fix his life and try to make himself a god person for the society i as person would give a second chance to that person to show me that he changed a wanna success on his life, that would be really nice.

Conclusion:

Everyone can change his first impressions of a person giving a opportunity to show that he is a god person even if he did a mistake he would be god for the society. ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0
9EC4A16802BF,"I believe music, drama, or art class should be classified as electives because some students might not be interested in these classes due to them are wanting to learn more about other subjects, consequently failing; furthermore, students may also have an interest in a certain job and do not need these classes, students can also find these classes a waste of time because they are learning a subject that is not aiding their future, students would also not take these classes serious because they are not necessarily an essential.

First, Students may find that the class is not of interest to them because they may want to learn about other subjects that could impact their future. Due to the students dissatisfaction and not being interested in the class they have a high probability for failure. For example, Generic_Name wants to reach his goal of going to a high end college but was not accepted because he had a GPA lower than the minimum requirement due to failing drama class.

Second, Students can also have an interest in a certain job. Music, drama, or art can be a waste of time for the student because it is taking time from classes that can help towards getting that job. Taking these classes could also help the student explore more possible job opportunities as well as learning skills.

Lastly, Some students would not take these classes serious. As oppose to essential classes like math, English, and history students would use these classes as an opportunity to horseplay. The students that are constantly participating in horseplay are going to be a distraction to the students trying to succeed in these subjects.

In conclusion, I believe music, drama, and art should classify as an elective because students may find that the class is not of interest to them, students can also have an interest in a certain job, and some students would not take these classes serious and take it as an opportunity to horseplay.

C8EF7048C03F,"When you're looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one person's own opinion.

One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. There are multiple options that can occur.

Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others people's opinion's about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if it's gonna be a bad time or a good time. After you have learned you can help out the one's in your same position or a little more different. But still can be able to help others in need. You can learn from it and help other's or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. Or even teach the one's need in teaching

One dislike I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best. It's really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

I think that having a very formal manger and attitude in life will get you a long ways in life then being grumpy and mean toward other people. That's why there is a saying teat people the way you want to be treated. Therefor you will get the same amount of respect that you put out there toward other people

Firstly, I do believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. Having all this positively and good energy will get you along way in life. Why you might ask your self. Having good positive energy will allow you to meet new people and they might want to interact with you for having good energy surrounding.

Secondly, this may allow you to meet new people. Meaning they might would like to share with you on how they found the key to success. After that you would probably would like to share the key to your success, and how it helped you accomplish your goals that you might have thought that you never would.

Thirdly, this may lead you to the success in life that you have been dreaming about. That being millionaire or stepping up in your woke place etc. Being joyful and happy in life will allow you to accomplish and allow you to work 100 percent good.

Lastly, all I have to say is that positive attitude is the key to success in life. The only reason I say this is,because I was one of those students that didn't interact with anyone because of my attitude. Now that I have learn and taught my self to be the person who I am today I have made so many friends that I didn't know I would talk.

57A6B1103088,"Classes Online At Home

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Some people think it is good idea to take classes online. They say they have more time to do they homework. Some people think that take classes online is more easy than going to school. But I think that is more difficult because nobody explain you the thing. If people take classes online they will be not learning nothing. In my opinion it's not good idea because people need help from teachers, some people like to come to school, and they like to distract at school.

Some people like to do they work by they self, but others people need help from teachers. For example my sister always stay after school for help from teachers. She said that they help her with the things she do not know about her classes. She said that she learn too much about her teachers, and she like to come to school because the teachers explain the work. For example when she fail a test she stay after school with the teacher, they review about the test, and she learn more. The teachers find the way to help students after school. The teachers have others things to do but they don't care because they want the students to pass their classes.

Some students like to come to school because they make friends and have fun. For example my brother Generic_Name like to play sports at school. He said that play at school it's fun because he talk with other people. School it's important because we have to know about other people and learn more about what is hapen at school. People have the opportunity to come to school everyday and learn. However, In my opinion is important to come to school because when you graduate you going to be happy with your diploma.

Others might say that classes online is good because they like to work lonely. The school distract people from their houses. Some people need distract and also need socialism with friends. At school is the place that people like and feel safe. For example my friend say that she get distract in school she play a sport, or do a activity with others friends. Also the best way to get distract is to speak with adults people that know more about life. Also distract is doing your homework and listen to music.

In conclution, the teachers help students and they explain the things that the students do not know and online they have to do by they self. Come to school is the best way to learn what you want with your life and want you want to became in your future. School have many distract like games, books that you can read and take home. I think students should come to school and not take classes online. The teachers are the best because they help to much the students. Also they are good persons because explain when you don't know nothing.

First, when we are accomplish something we need to be proud of yourself , it is wonderful when other people are getting done their goals.

Second, we may not believe on what other people said to you because sometimes you are right but if you pay attention you can go down with your goals, that why you have to finish your accomplish alone.

Also, when we done something we feel very happy and that can help us to follow what we actually need to be a great people.

For example: if we are idle we never can be great on our future, we need to know and be sure that if we do not follow our dream, it can not come true, like when you are in the college and you said i need to be a nurse or something like that you have to go to the college every single day and stay strong for all that you are making and when you done, you will see your that dream come true and them you can see all the effort that you did.

52F9582F9C86,"Every student should have the opportunity to be involved in extracurricular activities for them to enrich their educational experiences. Here are some reasons why they should be involved in activities, when they're involved in activities they have the opportunity to do different kind of stuff outside home, school, and even work. They also learn how to be independent and responsible. Also being in extracurricular activities could also help the students health.

First, when students are involved in activities outside school and home, it gives them the chance to experience different things outside school, home, or even work. They learn different kind of things. Things they wouldn't learn in school. For example during school they learn about math, science, history, and english. When they're home they do nothing but homework and help around the house some students have to work. If they're involved in activities, they have the opportunity to experience different kind of stuff for example: if a student decided to do a sport they would learn about that certain sport and they would also play it and enjoy it with a team. If they play a sport they would have to also practice at home, but not verse others or be in a team to practice with.

Second, students learn how to be more independent when involved in activities. For example, when I decided to join figure skating I wasn't independent, I didn't really know how to do things by myself, and when I joined at first it was kind of hard because I needed help with everything but as time passed by I started to learn how to be more dependent. I started doing almost everything by myself without any help, I was more dependent at home, school, and figured skating. Being involved in this activity, also taught me how to be more responsible. When doing activities you need to learn how to use your time wisely because you will need time for school, homework, family, and the activity you're involved in. Being involved in an activity is a good way to learn how to be responsible, how to be independent, and how to manage your time wisely.

Last, joining an activity can help with your mental and physical health specially if its a sport. Joining an activity is a good way to distract yourself from school, home, or work. This is because you will be thinking about the rules of the activity or about the point of that certain activity. It also helps your physical help meaning that it helps you exercise and it helps your body do what it needs to do. Being involved in a sport is a good way to help you exercise and distract yourself from other things. Being involved in activities such as sports or school clubs allows you to enjoy that time. If its something you really like then its something you can look forward to after having a bad day or a stressful day. When I had a bad day I would always think about skating and what I should do to make my jumps better. I would also go to the skating ring and practice, this helped me be more active and helped my physical health too. Being involved in a sport or any other activities is a good way to help students look forward for things.

Some people may argue that schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because some students don't have time to do school assignments but that shouldn't be their problem, that would be the students problem because students should know that if they join more than one activity they will still need to do school assignments such as homework or projects. Students should learn how to manage their time and use it wisely. Students and families should control the student involvement in extracurricular activities.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
90C81189C58D,"One day a random lady came up to me and called me gorgeous, and it made my day even better. The small things matter to someone. It helped me to show kindness to others because it impacted me and I want to impact others. Once you show small acts of kindness it can lead you to a better life. When people show small acts of kindness it can help someone's attitude to improve,

it can make someone's day better, help someone become a better person, and can help someone going through some hard times.

Showing small acts of kindness can help someone's attitude to improve by doing things that make them happy. Telling them what's wrong to say to someone so they know to not say it. Show love towards them because the attitude they have might may be really bad, but showing them love can help it improve a lot. Finally, they will slowly improve it might take time. The most important part is having a good attitude towards them even if you think it's not going to help it is because you're showing them how to give a good attitude back to anyone.

Helping someone's day better is by giving them a compliment it can effect them in the most positive way you can think off. Text them good morning and good night because you never know if there having a rough morning and night shows that you care. If you see them sad give them the biggest hug it can easily bright up there mood. Showing them acts of kindness can help them show kindness to others.

BBB9D66F934C,"So i think it we should do the four day school week here at Generic_School.

Because here are one advantage and one disadvantage. The one advantage is that the student will get a three day week end. And then here is a another advantage is that the student would have enough time to finish their homework and project. And then for the one disadvantage is that the student would have a longer school day because they are adding the eight hour that we are going to miss for Friday school day. they would be dividing that eight hour of school for the four day of school that we are going to have. and then here is a another disadvantage like would the student who play sport have short practice because of this like if we do in real life would that actually happen.

So here is my first reason why it is a good reason for this to happen because it would save the school a bunch of money on electric bill. And then here is another good reason that we should do this is that it would help the teacher teach to student understand the material a little bit better. And then here is second reason why it is a bad reason to do this and school like this will give student who play sport a short time to do homework at home because they have school then after school they have practice

So in conclusion we should try this for a month and then after that month we can see if we should keep this thing going on for the rest of the school year. like we can ask the student if they want it to stay. Or we can back the regular secudule like we go the regular time that we get school and then we go back to the five day school week. like in my opinion we should try this out and see how this turn out like would most of the student like this or would most of them hate like i think this is going to be like a 50 50

chance of this working and not working. like i feel like most of the student would like and the rest of student hating this because the extending hour of the school day but the student who are going to love this is because of the three day weekend and then for the teacher they all would love this idea for the school year",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
D9018539576D,"Technology has had the biggest impact on human interaction. Most people might say it's made a positive impact on people's lives while others may disagree and say it's had a negative impact on people's lives. There may be some pros and there may be some cons to this situation. Can the impact of technology be a good or bad outcome?

Let's start off with the pros or the positive effects technology has had on people's lives, now technology has made people's lives easier. Some may say because it's easier to access what they need easier online instead of heading to the market. Some may also say it's easier and faster to call your friends or parents, any family member really, instead of driving all the way to them, which is true. Watching movies on your phone instead of going all the way to the movie theater and pay for your ticket and it only being a one time thing. There are countless positives outcomes of how technology has increased over the years. The technology nowadays makes everything faster and easier on people's lives. Unfortunately, all these great, glamorous, fast, and easy ways have some downfall to them.

Now, technology definitely has it's flaws and negative impacts on people's lives. Most can say there's not as much human interactions since technology has been brought upon people. Communication is key when interacting with one another. Today most people are also glued to their cellular device, not physically but you get the point. Especially teenagers, they have a bad habit of not being able to put down their cellphone. Whether that being during school hours, at home when you're supposed to be doing work, and maybe even at work. The generation we have today is usually all about social media, and just being on their cellphone in general 24/7. Point blank there's just no physical, verbal communication anymore between one another. It may be causing a lot of students to slack in school, and it may not only go for students and teenagers, they're not the only victims. Some particular parents may be also glued to their cellphone just as teenagers. It's not their fault nor do the teenagers have any fault in this. All this is because of the evolution of technology. It's not pleasant to live in a world with not so much communication and everyone being constantly glued to their cellphone nor is it pleasant to do awful in school because you can't put your cellular device down. Now, these are just some reasons and examples why technology has a negative impact on people's lives. Can you imagine how many more scenarios like this happen daily?

Though technology has evolved drastically through out the years and is still evolving now as we speak, there's always going going to be positive and negative impacts. Technology does help and allow people to complete tasks without having contact with others. There's the problem right there, there's no communication. Even though there are some positive effects of technology that doesn't change the fact that there are more negative effects than positive. Technology effects each person a different way, whether that being in a positive way or whether that being in a negative way. It's all a mix, and by mix I refer to positive effects and negative effects all over the place. Some people may disagree or may agree whether it's a bad mixture or a good mixture. Cell phones and all technology can make it easier or harder for certain people.

Whether if it truly is a positive or negative impact it will not change what people think or at what position they're in. Some people just like taking the easy way out and not cope with what they are losing and missing out on, communication. Human communication and interactions are not it anymore. Everyone's opinion and saying on this dilemma is different, people's mindsets are different even their actions are different from everyone else's,but this is my opinion. In conclusion, that is why I strongly, and genuinely believe technology has a negative effect on people's lives.            ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0
99A3641592CA,"Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think it's important? Let's see why I think it's important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you can't do. If you just immagine or think bigger about what you want or what you want to do. One day you will achive your goal or dream.

One of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you don't immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort. If you don't learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. Which means effort creates achivements. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. But they only need one. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school.

Second reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you don't immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. That's what a lot of people do. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. Although they said that you started a company anyways. After a month no one wanted to invest you company. You kept asking people to invest your company. So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. Then nothing happened to your company. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them.

Third reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. When I go to school. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine.

So I think immagination is more important than knowledge. But knowledge is still really important. I feel like everything starts with immagination first. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality.    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
523130079501,"""Their are advantages of cell phone usage in class but their even more disadvantages to it."" cell phones aren't great for students to use in classroom because it cause distraction and make students not focus while teachers give instructions. Teenagers get so easily distracted by anything because they are careless and aren't aware. Phones aren't beneficial nor useful. Students should use either school or home laptop it is more beneficial and useful than cell phones and in that ways teachers will be easily find out what they have done in class.

First of all, the reason why cell phones aren't useful for students in classroom for educational purpose it's because of distraction; that will bother the whole class ,and might bother teachers too. Since cell phones are one of the rule to be use in class then all have to follow it. For instance, if teacher assign work for students to do during class on their phones imagine what will be the result nothing might be done by the end. Laptops have big screen so that teachers can follow up with their students. With cell phones is difficult for teachers to know weather or not the student have done something in class. Students have good tricks especially teenagers. They might be acting like they are working but truly they are messaging ,and once the teacher approach he/she change the page so they can show evidence that they are working. Teachers are even smarter they know how to deal with students like this. They either sit with them to help them out or ask to come after school if they really struggle and can't do nothing.

In this situation is a good idea for teachers to collect phone before class starts and hand them back by the end. Any advice could be more useful then cell phone. That is also the reason why cell phones aren't beneficial.

Additionally, cell phones aren't always beneficial the reason why is because it distract easily. It cause problems between students. For example, if their are two students playing soccer on their phone how will they focus; they can't control themselves one shout happy scores ,and the one who lost want to beat the other guy who win and so on. Cell phones shouldn't be use at all in class but only with teachers permission. It will be even better if two teachers help out in the class with work. They both will help students pay attention and participate. Both together will be able to control phones usage. It is hard when you are working on an essay and suddenly a message pop up you can't control yourself ,and you can't focus just because of the message you are carious and really want to know what is happening. That is the reason why cell phones shouldn't be use in class just because of distraction and the impact that might happen to students from using it.

However not everyone agree, some argue that cell phones is great to be use in schools for educational purposes. First think about the disadvantage that could happen with this use or rule. Think about others and how that might effect them. Will you be able to control yourself if you receive a text from a friend?. In fact, there are many things that might cause distraction but one of the biggest distraction are cell phones ,however, any other things can be control. Any other device will be okay because it will easy to be seen by teachers. Cell phones won't help you at all however it will bring your grades down and it will bother you. Not everyone have same opinion other have positive view on the use of cell phones. Which is okay but think about it more. Look to it's positive and negative impact on students and you fill find the answer.

Why most students will agree with the use of cell phone in class?. Some student aren't always aware of what they are doing and they are careless. They think messaging or whatever they are doing in class is more important then their grades. Students should avoid all distraction such as food, cell phones, and music to help our society develop.

If all students focus and pay attention that will have a huge impact on the environment.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
CDDFBBACC7B6,"I think that people find community parks,state parks enjoyable. Because everyone can go to them, family time and also if your stress you can go there.

My first reason why i think that community parks or state parks are the best is because everyone can go to them. You and your friends can go and just have a blast. There's so much stuff to do like play sports with other people .You can even meet new people that you don't even know. Because not everyone that is there your gonna know because everyone can go. For example the Generic_City park that place is so fun you can play sports with you family and buy stuff like food,clothes and other stuff.

my second reason is that you can have family time. Family time is so important to me because your family is always going to be there for you and the park is a great place to spent time with them. You can meet up with your family at the park. And also you can have a small little birthday party and just have fun there with your family. If you have little sibling they are going to love it because there's a park and kids love the park and the adults can be talking like your aunt with your mom. And also i fell like being outside with your family is better because you just get to look at the trees and nature instead of being inside.

my last reason is if your stress, i been stress before and i feel like the best places to go are the parks because you just can forget about everything and just draw or write. And if your stress you can do so much things like yoga and after cumming things. The park can also help people in different ways like they can be relaxing .And also if your going throw something i feel like being outside is the best thing because if your inside your only going to get worse. So the park can help in different ways like stress.

In conclusion the reasons why the community parks or the state parks are enjoyable or people might find them enjoyable is because everyone can go to them, family time and If your stress. And you can do more fun stuff not just this. I love to go to the community parks because i get to spent time together with my family and we just have a good time. And also it helps me in so many ways going to the park like if i stress or just having a bad day. That's why i feel like community parks are enjoyable and a great place to go and just have fun the next time you go. Do you like community parks?           ",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
A6AECACCFAA8,"A problem can be good or bad. you can learn from the problem that you made. Sometimes you can't learn from the problem you did. I can agree and disagree with this statement. Not all people can think it can be true because you can do something wrong and get in trouble for it. You can keep doing the same problem and not care for it.

You can choose what your problem's are. You don't need to have a problem to do your best. You can be good at something and not have a problem with it. Some problems are good because you learn from what's good and bad. If you do something that's wrong it's ok. Because doing the right thing can be hard for people to do. Much of the time theirs something you can't do about it.

People choose to take the wrong path for their life and some don't. The ones who take the wrong path will go though a lot trouble. They would have a lot of problem's that they can't change but just cause you that path doesn't mean you change it. Even the ones who are living good doesn't mean their not going though some problems because everyone does.

So what I think it's trying to tell us is would you work out your problems to become the best. You can change one problem that's is stopping you from doing something. That you can change the wrong thing to a good thing. Even if you mest up doesn't mean you are bad. Learn from the problem you did and grow up as you learn form it.

7445CD7E0985,"According to the text I think is a good idea that students can graduate from high school in three years because if you graduate from high school very early you are going to get a lot of opportunities to be successful in life, I also think that if someone decide to start working contraction or hard works like that early, three years later that person going to get a lot of experience and money and if you decide go to college or some like that when you graduate from college you going to be young and ready for life, that's how a lot of people became millinery, because the must time you spend doing something that's more experience that you going to get, and when you got experience and you know what you doing, and what you want you life going to be better and easier in the future.

People also think that it is a bad idea graduate from high school in three years because they said that is to early, and you don't going to be smart enough to be successful in life but I said "" that's wrong because we still have to go to summer school and take extra classes in summer school and you have to be very smart because you need to pass all you classes you cannot fail any class because if you fail one you need to take it in summer school again and that's going to be a problem so if you want to graduate early you also have to take classes online so you're going to be very busy so they should be ready for the next level.

I know someone that he is from Dominican Republic but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and i ask him

"" what did you do to be so successful? he told me this "" when i was 16 years old I graduate from high school' then i ask ""how you graduate so early and he told me that he take classes in summer school and he take classes online"" i said that' s good ""keep telling me how you became succesfull "" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old so he have to work for one year if he want to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything.

Another thing is that not everybody make it,

is hard but i have i tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the and your mom and dad don't going to be there to pay for you food you going to be the man in that house so that's why everybody need to work hard everyday if they one to be successful in life.

In conclusion the best thing for student in graduate early because the must experience you get doing something the must money you going make and for me life is about perseverance, progress, and be successful because if you don' got nothing nobody going to respect you, and you need to help the people that cannot make it because people fail sometime life is not that easy for some people is you got the opportunity to do it good in life take that opportunity.

However does that believe that is not a good idea that students commit at the young age one reason is that they will file tire , because when they want to pay atention to math class and they see that the teacher is talking to much they are going to say no I want to sleep to to be in this class borring,second when they are in the corridor study for a quiz and they will be talking about the career and when they are going to take the quiz they will know nothing because they did not study .

Does who believe that is a good idea for students to commit a career at the young age give one reason ,one reason is that tey can see can the life is very hard and they will have to do there own thing ,second is that they can buy a car so because if they shoes a good career they are going to resif a lot of money so can have a car and help there family with other thing at home .

Finally that career it have to be good some you are not going to be looking for another commit career because you try hard and ask you family and teacher to help you to fun a good one, second if you like that career you most talk wit you mom or dad that you are happy with that and tell you teacher that help you to found that career and tell her can you will talk to other students to come and talk to the teacher so she can help them .

yes and no; yes, because students who are taking online classes or taking classes at home would be more focused, since there's no distraction like other students or teachers. No, because it is not very active socially and physically, unlike going to school, interacting with people, and playing sports.

Also, if the internet's not working then the student would have to skip the class because internet is what loads the videos and is used for face timing with the students. Some students can't learn just by watching a video or taking an online class, they have to actually experience the situation to understand. But the majority of the students can learn from videos and online classes.

16C794A0F479,"students should not be allow to use their cellphone during class time only if it is necessary or with the teacher permission.

One of the most important reason why you should not be allow to use your phone during class is because the cellphone really distract you, it may be because you're playing, text ting or listening music.

Cellphone can be a big distraction for the student for to many reasons, sometimes students do not really think like that, but on my opinion it is a big distraction, using the cellphone during class can make you miss important parts from the class that you may need for a future test that maybe one of the answer can be that small part that you didn't hear because you were on your phone, but the teacher is not the responsible from your actions, you take your own decisions,and you choose the decision to look at your phone than pay attention at class. in other parts teachers should make that their rules for the classroom has appraisal, and make the students respect them, or if the teacher can't do that at least the school can make that rule.

Some times you're just pretending that you are paying attention, but you're not really paying attention for the reason that you may be at your phone or answering a text, i am saying this because it happened to me and i do the same, i know some students has the same situation and others that can't live without their cellphone. it can be addictive. some times I think it can because the age, we are just young persons and some persons think different they really come to study but others just come because they have to.

The effects of being using the cellphone at class are that you not really pay attention at class and you fail the class. cellphones are not necessary at class and it's not educational or helpful for you to remained or learn things. On my person i fail classes because the same situation, i fail classes and if i fail classes i'll fail the school year and then wont would like to repeat other school year. That gonna make me think about that and i don't would like to come to school because i feel like i loose my time coming to school to repeat it every single day. i think cellphone make you stupid and act like a dumb because when youre on your phone, you are like in other world, you don't pay attention on what is happening around you. you are loosing time from your life time that you can use study or do others necessary and important things for your life. i see students that they just dgf and they on their phone during class, i'm one of them, lol.

On my opinion, cellphone can be necessary some times, but i dont really need it during class because i come to study, take notes and do my best in class for have good grades, i will say that cellphone can be use only during test, classwork because i am that kind of person that likes to be listening relax songs and doing my job. in other way schools gives you a laptop and i think the only thing where you can do all of those things is the computer, i can use Google or YouTube, it's not necessary to have your phone on your hands.

How can we solve this issue? teachers should collect all cellphones before start class, and make a rule that something gonna happen if he/she see someone with their phone, so students may have to respect this rule.

All this conversation i think the problem is not cellphone, i think the problem is technology because humans are depending from technology and and it makes them fool, todays technology can be more smart than a person. if you really read to this side you should understand how is life now, you may be older and smarter than i am, but we both lived different generations, it is all my decisions, we have to control technology not technology has to control us. legalize ;)",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
03CB73341E0E,"Do you think its a good idea to have somone make your decisions for you all the time? There is somthing you should know about having a person make decisions for you, and making decisions for yourself. I think making your own decision is the best way to solve life important problems, and I will tell you why I think so.

Making your own decisions is a sign of taking your life to the next level in many ways. Ways such as maturity, self confidence, determination, and intelligence. The reason why taking others advice all the time isnt good is because there is going to be a time where no one will be there for you when you make that life changing decision or in a situation where you have to make the decision right away. When you learn to follow your own instincts and learn to make your own decisions is the moment you can show others that you are a responsible for your actions, That you are a fully matured adult. At the end of the days its all about whats best for you and the people around, the people who depend on you.

Having somone make your decisions for you is a sign that you are not ready for the real world. Like I said before, you will get to that specific point in your life when you are just going to have to make this important decision. Thats why its always important to learn to follow on what you think is right. Your dependents when you were a kid, always taught and told you what the best thing to do is. So when you get old enough to make decisions on your own, you know whats best for you. The times you should be taking advice from others is when you're a learning child. A child learning off examples from your parents or dependebles. The times when you should be making decisions for yourself is the times when you have learnt off these examples as a child from your dependents, now to grow up as an adult and do whats best for you. And the cycle continues. I think its more understandable when you put it that way.

In conclusion, self decision making shows you are a responsible adult in many ways. And most importanly shows you are ready for obsticles that will come in your way in the real life. depending on others just shows you still need people to make these decisions for you even though there will certainly be a time when there will be no one but you. And this will really hurt you if you dont start to take responsibility for yourself and your dependents. So yes, I think people should make there own decisions.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0

Why someone might find that activity enjoyable?, i will explain and give specific details.

As we all know that parks provide many activities for us. One enjoyable activity is playing soccer ,You don't need to have good skills to play soccer. Many teens play soccer or they are in a soccer team , because they enjoy it. I know there is a lot of enjoyable activities , but i chose soccer. I play soccer with my friends and family , we really find it enjoyable to go outdoors and have some fun together. Many kids don't like going outside because they think sports are boring , But they aren't boring to me. In the summer time parks are open for you to enjoy activities with your kids and family.

Your kids will enjoy playing soccer with their friends outdoors. Many parents don't let their kids go places with their friends , because they think something bad might happen to them.

Meanwhile , many kids like to play other sports that are different than soccer , but they still enjoy it. Soccer is the same as many sports kids do at school or at parks. Teens spend their time at parks playing many sports during the summer time. My family go to parks to enjoy the water and play games that they never played before. If i enjoy playing soccer i think you will too , why not have some fun and probably hurt ,but hope that doesn't happen to anyone. You feel free when you play a sport you like to play or you might want to try a new sport. Always try something new because there isn't a lot of time to enjoy moments like that.

during football games the players can be really loud and anoying and tease you wich can be bad and get people mad that has happened alot during football history.

AD6986B56719,"Michelangelo once said ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" I agree with this because we should never set our standards low even if it means we will reach our goal quicker; we should always have a strong mindset in completing and tackling hard tasks no matter how hard it can be. This can be mentally be difficult for some people because they like to quit when something is too hard for them, this shows how weak minded a person can be and end up never completing that achievement. If you're setting your achievement low knowing that you can complete it, why do it then? It will be a waist of time and you'll most likely get no satisfaction out of it.

Waking up in the morning and looking at your to do list and seeing that hard goal you have to complete can really throw off people. They look at it and starting off their morning can put them in a bad mood. This can mean that the person is not mentally strong enough to finish his or her task, it can take weeks, months, or even years; some people just dont have the patience for it. This most likely means that you'll never complete anything difficult in your life and end up always choosing an easy goal knowing you can complete it in a short amount of time, That type of mindset will never get you anywhere in life, no one will want a lazy person working for them in the future; they'll want a hard working and determined individual.

A person should always set a task for them that is hard, but something they know they can complete. This can be working overtime at your job for that sports car you've always wanted or even just saving up money for retirement. Setting your goal low can mean the person will never grow up to be a strong individual or even be a hard worker. After completing your goal you should always get lots of joy, happiness, and satisfaction; if you're not getting any of those you're doing something wrong. It should never feel like your goal was just a waist of time or you did this for nothing, you should come out of your goal as a stronger and happier person.

Having a negative attitude can play huge role in why you're not completing hard goals. Two keys factors in completing a hard task are having the right mindset and having a positive attitude; Having neither of these will already be putting you in a major disadvantage. Through out your day you should always have a positive personalty, who would want to talk to an angry and negative person? These are very difficult skills to learn it takes patience and time, but already having these two key traits can put you in the biggest advantage for completing your hard task. Not lots of people embrace these because they think they are useless that it has nothing to do with your mind but more about the actions of the person.

In conclusion I highly agree with Michelangelo's statement, it can sometimes bring out the worst in us but that is how we grow and learn as a person. This quote separates the lazy week minded people out there from the hard working, strong minded, and positive people. Setting a hard task and taking the time to complete can influence yourself into completing harder goals you have planned for yourself in the future. This is how successful people are born and become who they are and make a name for them self, no millionaire would ever tell you to set your standards low just because you feel like you can't complete a hard goal; they would tell you to push yourself mentally and physically no matter what the cost may be. Some people are just born without that mentality that most successful people posses, you cant teach lazy but you most certainly can teach hard work, determination, striving, and dedication.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5

people can be convinced by looking at other people`s example because they think that doing what others do is better.

In my opinion we should give more than one example to the people because one can not be enough for people who do not believe what other say, so what we need is more options where they can find their influences. Giving more than one option is giving them a chance to choose them what they can be influence by.

Not many many other schools have this program to get extra help and kids need to understand that the there is a big opportunity that is being given to them and they need to take it.

This program helps the younger students get a opportunity to get better at something that they are having a hard time on inside of school.

If the kids are having a hard time on doing work at home or not understanding, they dont have to get worried about there grades dropping because there are other options that you can do.

If the younger kids parents do not have that much time to sit and help them with work, then they can just get help from the learning program that happens at there school.

The more you go to the meetings the better you will get even if it takes time.

I also feel that this could be important to the older kids that help as well.

This program would do very good for their service hours for there service hours for school.

It must be a good feeling for them because they were chosen to do something they are good and smart at.

Lets say that students want this the same school schedule that has a longer winter break, a year-round schools, and a week off in the spring and fall because people want more time to do spend time with family, do homework, projects etc...

First, We can spend time with family and friends, we can watch a movie with them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. We need families to stay together as a group because if we don't then we are going to miss them too much as we go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody wants to stay alone because if they want to stay alone that's okay if you want.

Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney world etc... I love going to the pool in the summer because we don't have to stay at our house all day and all night. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. We must stay with our family because they love you so much and they want to spend time with you too.

Finally, We can relax from work and studying we are tired of working so hard that we need a break. We are studying so hard for school, we did lots of tests and quizzes that we are tired from. We all enjoy summer vacation because we can spend time with our family and friends, we can invite our friends to eat , go to mall, watch a movie etc...

In conclusion, We must spend time with family and friends to go anywhere in the world for a vacation. We can enjoy each other by going to a amusement park or a museum to play and take pictures to save it on our phone for memories.

It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing.

Third reason i feel like if i stay int the same bubble i will never grow out of it by being scared and not having positive feeling's toward's me. I just think it isn't easy as it looks to loose something and seeing the you won't grow from it.

people just think giving up on things you like doing is easy to forget but it 's not because that's something you love doing and you've mastered doing in all your life you've kept that postive view in your mind people just give up when they realize that they can't continue that's how you will never grow by giving up it's hard to when you come to a point that you commited a bad thing and you regret doing you cant take it back but life is also giving us the chance to improve and forget about everything and continue to grow bigger from that small place you feel inside you never give up on anything just continue on what you feel confident on doingand be happy.

Another suggestion is asking for help to those who knows how to guide and gives ideas to people following their own decisions . Having some different types of ideas from different people or culture it can help us to work and do better in life because life's important matters. It can help our sociatity do better for our new childrens and the anyone whos around in our environment.

First of all, some particular people sometimes shouldnt always follow their heart or emotions whether is right or wrong we can always seek for help and do what we like to do in our daily life. For example, the other day I made the worst decision because I didn't have the courage to share my thoughts with anyone in my family or friend about quitting my job or not. I felt like if I suggested to ask someone to help me clear my mind I was going to do better now. Next, later on I saw my manager and told me they had a better job position for me with better health insurance plan. In this case I feel that seeking for guidance is not always a bad idea, is the opposite we can help each other. I made a bad decision for not comunicating with others about my problem whether to stay or leave, what i did it was left the job.

Secondly, in many cases we think we know a lot, but in reallity is that other people can help us to do and give new ideas in our life. Than, If I want to change something in my life I have to love myself more and have the courage to comunicate with others and let them know what I am thinking and expect a better results. On the other hand, making your own decision can also help you to be succesful about life and not depend on others. For example, someone whos expert, can let me know and give me some advices about a proyect because they alredy know it or went through and have lots of experiences in that area. I always believe imformation is important if we working as a team is the best for the human we get to know each other time and values. Although, everything works best when we seek for a true guidance.

To conclude, in many cases people are really succesful because they met or know someone from different culture and shares different types of ideas. In this world we live in many times this is the best way to work with as a team by seeking help from experience people and open up our brain more to understand the problem and to move on forward in our life.

CFEC920440CE,"We accomplish more by doing tasks that we are assigned with to complete.

We have always get something done if the tasks or assignments are done.

Take for example people that work jobs, day and night they tend to get work or tasks or assignments done.

How do they get stuff done, workers usually plan it out like steps to go though to complete them if they dont follow the steps like how are they going to complete the task or assignment to get it done. Workers always need to plan it out before proceeding to the task or assignment to finish or complete. For example Generic_Name wants to figure out how to complete his project, he need to plan step by step and what materials he needs for the project. He follows the step by step plan but realizes what he needs to do later on he gathers the materals and starts to complete his project just by always doing it.

All of us always have to something to complete any tasks or assignments to finish.

It's not going to work if we dont always doing something or plan it out , it's the reason why if you wanna get it stuff done you have always do it in order complete it. For example take school students for a example, they tend to always to get work done so they can free time to themselves and usually making sure the answers they write down are correct to get good grades. School students have determation to complete classwork they're assigned to, so later on they don't have to complete it for homework at home for free time. It's better to always complete work so you don't have to complete later on. For example any job work usually has work to do like car manufactures , they have a assembly to work on because it's where the cars are starting to be made by the workers in the assembly line. They have to work the machines to put the parts on the cars that are being work on so it can shipped of to the car dealership. Everything revolves around on always getting something on time, so it doesn't become a problem later on. Everyone like to job workers to school students alwayss have to something , its why we tend to get stuff done.

Always accomplish it by doing it

Reasons why, we have to do it if we tend to get our task or assignments done then that work doesn't get it the way of what you are trying to on the next task. Accomplishing that we are trying to get to is a good way to start off, you see like CEOs of a company planning what they want done and to figure it how to accomplish it. For example take CEOs they're good at getting stuff done and accomplished it pefectly cause they own businesses and tell his workers what food products or drinks that stores need for people to attract to buy their goods or clothes. People always have to plan to work towards to they want to achieve or accomplish even for their future. it's not going to work if you don't put the effort into the assignment or tasks to make it happpen. You always have to make sure what you want and to make it happen so that your future has more opportuniites.

FB5F33FEC99F,"Did you know that participating in after school activities or clubs benefits students educational wise?

Weather it's joining a sports team, or theater art, or even practicing an instrument, they all educate you in a way.

There are many activities that arent just educational, but students will also find enjoyable, such as sports, art and music.

There are many types of sports, football, basketball, soccer and many many more to choose from.

Sports teaches you a lot about health, and why it's important to stay healthy. It also helps you stay fit and in shape. Playing sports can also give you a scholar ship for collage, but all that a side it's also fun and enjoyable. You get to hang with your friends, compete with other schools and teams, carry the schools name, and most importantly win trophies and receive rewards.

At some schools, they even let you go on field trips to other states to fields and courts to compete with other teams.

It's nice to have so many people come and support you and cheer you on at games, even when it gets competitive.

Drawing, painting, doodling or crafting are all ways of art. Some students have a hard time expressing their feelings, so they do it through art. They express their feelings and emotions through the colors and the designs and subliminal messages they hide in their paintings.

Art clubs get to go to art museums and art gallery's that inspire and improve their talent.

They even get to do art competitions and win prices and art gallery's of their own to hang on the walls around the school. Painting or Drawing your mood is one way to enjoy yourself and become more passionate for the talent you have.

Art is very deep, interesting and meaningful,yet many people don't really understand art that much. It's fun to experiment with colors and textures, for art has no limit.

Many students join bands and music clubs simply because they enjoy playing or singing.

There are many different types of instruments to choose from, like band and string, but they are very different.

bands do not include string instruments, nor do string instruments include band.

Singing is also one of the ways students like to have fun and enjoy themselves, as well as playing there favorite instrument. Music is also art and a talent that not most people really have. students get to go to opera's concerts and very famous theaters to meet very famous musicians. They also get to preform on stages and before every school game, they also get to compete in music competitions were they get to earn and receive valuable rewards.

They also get to upgrade their instruments every year to the finest quality.

In conclusion, There are many activities that arent just educational, but also very enjoyable, like sports, art and music. Learning should not be all serious, strict and stressful,but should be fun, enjoyable and lovable. Education is important, but loving to learn is more important to sussed. These activities and clubs teaches students something new everyday and helps in developing the brain skills. Education is fun but sometimes it's good to be serious, or strict in some situations.                    ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
B9733BDA883E,"High school the place where we can all do anything we want and just a step before going to college, or at least this is what a lot of middle schoolers think. In high school we take so many classes that are required and those classes are supposed to open up doors and get us closer to our goals. But, classes like arts, music or drama will give us something that we cannot get from others classes. These classes are like a little break, just a whole class to forget about having to write an essay or doing some long math equations and, instead just have fun with friends and enjoy singing, painting and even acting. These classes teach the students how to socialize and communicate with others.

High school is not as easy as some would think, students usually get really stressed because they have to pass their classes, their Sols and start getting prepare for college all at the same time. There is where classes like this can give a little opening to reduce some of that stress. Usually the environment in this classes is always joyful and fun, it is a place where students can learn through socializing and having fun. Who knows may be students would never think they like music but after some months taking music they would find out they love it and decide to become a musician and that can also happens with art and even drama. Classes like this not only give a little time off all the stress and pressure from high classes but also can give lessons to students that they would never even imagined they would learn.

Now, think about a extremely coy student who has never had the confidence to speak up in class not even to ask a question their math class, we know we all have asked something in math is just a class that at least a question per unit seems mandatory. However, how can that same student later on give a speech or have the valor to push himself up in a big company if he never has learned how to properly communicate. Even if he has huge talent and the brain of a genius he will never be successful. In life being able to express ourselves is something required, something that we have to do if we want to move keep moving up our hill path. Nothing will be easy but communication is a social skill we all have to learn.

Many will not agree on this and can will make strong arguments on how this classes are a waste of time. That after all we do not get anything from this classes and students just see these classes as a place to hang around with friends and procrastinating for 90 minutes. well, what about those students that do not have friends, students that always sit back in a corner and the teacher has never get him to say something. The students no one has ever heard from, or sometimes even noticed they are there. Shouldn't school concern about them, shouldn't school be the place where they can grow and open up their winds to start flying on their sky of opportunities.

""Tu voz habre puertas"" It is something i heard from a commercial once i was watching TV with my mom, it means ""Your voice opens up doors"" but those doors will never open if we open our mouths to ask questions that will give us answers those answers will impulse us further in life. Not matter how smart a student can be but if they cannot make themselves be notice their brilliant brain will be worthless.",3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.0,3.5
214EC21D1403,"I agree that positive attitude is the key of success in life. Because the importance of having a good attitude is to never doubt yourself that you can't do it when all you have to put is work. Working hard is most of the common things you can do to pass High School and College. Then you start searching up for things that you're interested to do after you finish college like a job which you have to have a positive attitude to pass the interview and treat customers good. Positive attitude will change your life forever.

One, Having a positive attitude will get you anywhere. You want to have a good image that its positive. You have to be hopeful and confident about the future. In many places is hard to find a good successful job, which all you have to do is have good attitude in front of the manager and if you get it keep your head up always don't let that ruin you. For example, their is a lot opportunities for a good successful job, but you have to keep working hard until you get what you wanted.

Two, Feeling good about yourself is sometimes what you need to have success. If its necessary to take away people to have good feeling about you is good so you can focus more on want to do in life. You are the only person that can control yourself or behavior. Take little five minutes to think and prove to yourself that you can do it without any help. For example, If you don't like Monday mornings all you have to do is reflect a positive thought on your mind that will make you happy the rest of the day.

Three, Show your best work by doing right thing in life to success. If you have you head up always and sometimes you need to think is good for yourself which make you a better person my reflecting a good image. Be honest to yourself and never take life for granted. Is important that you have a good positive attitude by doing this stuff which will led you to a good successful career. For example, You have a big interview that is gonna require a lot hard work cause this can define your future and you want to be successful in life overall if you pass and have all the techniques you need you're good then, but if not then you will keep trying until you get it right.

I agree that positive attitude is the key of success in life. In this life you can be whatever you want,but all you have to do is work hard. Have a positive mind set and positive attitude this will led you to have a good things in life. Have faith on yourself to get back what you want. The success don't come along in just one day you have to keep working hard to reach the top and have what you always wanted. Success will pay you off at the end when you have reach the top and all from it was to have a positive attitude and be the greatest person ever.

Some peple believe that choose a career at a young age can be beneficial for the students while other people believe choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big responsibility, you do not have enough time to think about new options, over the time students gets new skills and you have to be sure about what you really want. This is important because it is not easy for students have expecifics aspirations and good options of careers at a young age.

First, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you have to be sure about what you really want, you have to inform you about others posibilities, you need to know what are the benefits that some careers offer to you. For example, some schools offer to you a tutor and they help you to decided based on your interests and they recommended have differents options and spend a lot of time thinking about what is more covinient for you.

Secondly, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you do not have enough time to think about new options. For example, when you are in high school you need to take your time and investigate patiently what careers are more availables for you, you need to concentrated on what you are interested becauase everyone have differents aspirations and differents visions of life.

However, not everyone agree with this position some people claim that choose a career at a young age can be beneficial for the students because that way you have an expecific goal and you can focus more in what you need.

Students stays for homework help, finish their homework early, and turn in their homework on time. So ,we all have our homework to turn in on the next day. They're a lot of students that do their homework, dont do it, or some students might said, ""I forgot my homework.""

Should people bring their homework to school? Of course, or what, you're just going to leave it at your house and forget to bring it at school. Always do your homework and do your homework at home or afterschool. On the next day, just prepare to turn in your homework and if you forget to bring your homework, ask your teacher and give a good reason why you left your homework. Then you can turn in your homework on the next day.

People need help on their work. That's why they needed an afterschool homework club. They can go to their teacher to help what they need. If they go to afterschool and get a good helper, then they can be better and will know what they learn at afterschool. We can improve all of the students to get a good knowledge and success, to be a good students.

So students needs to turn in their homework and get a good grade. So, if you want that grade, you have to achievement and pass the class and get good grades. Turning your homework is one of the important grades to success and go your grade up. You can help other students that needs help on a subject. Why, because helping someone will learn from you and they will know how to solve a problem. They might do something and turn in. That's why people needs a good grade and be smart on something they known.

C5E45F477A84,"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are.

Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldn't get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude.

Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didn't like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didn't want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didn't take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldn't because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you don't know them.

First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are.

Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change.

Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think it's a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change.

In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

7F21F77E9AA3,"Big Responsibility Young Age

In most common societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they ending high school but in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter school. What is the best? We'll figure out. Is not a easy thing to do, decision the most difficult thing to do in life and even more when your young.

Trying to know what a person want at young age it must be difficult, everybody pretend that you must know what you want at young age when you always have get everything by your parents, grand parents, aunt, uncle or tutor.

You can't know what you want to do in your life even if you haven't live by your self.

I don't think it's a good idea for students to star stressing them just when they have enter to school because school can be hard some times even if it's your first year at high school even if you are smart, so I don't think that could work making a student stressing at young age. Student have to do other stuff not only thinking about careers they want to take, students have to do homework, some students have to help their parents and get a job to help them some students love to do sport. Students also need help and time to know what they want for the rest of their life. Young people have to do it carefully because their future depends on their decisions on the present.

It's hard for a students to decide what they want for they life for instance when I was at 9 grade my parents told me, if you don't know what career you want to take it's fine you have 4 years to decide. When my parents told me this I felt so peaceful and relax because I had time to see what career I

want to take and I had time to get information about careers that were interesting for me. And I could do better at school because I didn't have to keep thinking about careers that I want for my life because I could do that in my free time.

In conclusion if a student it's a really young age let them think what they want not only because it's at young age it's also because they going to pick something that it's for the rest of their life. Not easy for a young boy or girl to know what they going to decide to do for the rest of their life, specifically when they haven't discovered what life is like. The only way that you could decide what career you want being a early age it's with help of God.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,3.5

I disagree that school should be more than eight hours because teachers can not manage their time, all staff will get tired, and some student have to take care of their family.

Teachers can not manage their time. For example, my math teacher Generic_Name he has another job he won't be able to manage his time between teaching the student and the other job. On the other hand, most teachers have kids and they send kids to baby care and they pay money. For example, my science teacher Generic_Name she was not able to stay after school because she has kids. Imagine you have make up work that needs to be done but your teacher is busy?

All staff will get tired. Imagine teachers, students, and people who in the cafeteria how they get tired if we make this decision? For example, I feel bad about the people who clean the cafeteria each day. All teachers will have hard time to explain to the student. For instance, I have my cousin he lives in Turkey. Their classes is about two hours and half. My cousin told me I have hard time to understand the teacher on the end of the class because he get tired.

Some Student have to take care about their family. For example, When I came from Iraq my mother had heart problem so I have to take care of her each day. My mother she was not able to cook and stand I was responsible to do that. However, when I was in my country I was responsible about my nephews as well.

Some say extending school hours is hopeful for student. They are wrong because some student don't like school so they will drop out. Some say student will have finish the school early. They are wrong student will be rushing and not able to get the lesson from first time.

E0EBA1995BCB,"First impressions works as a normal form to react to a person, the impressions will depend how scary or funny it is, and how people feel in that moment. Impressions are almost impossible to change, they come instantly, people can not have control of it because first impressions come naturally from the human, the maind sends the first impressions when people are impressed, and people are not prepared to the first impressions. It is impossible to change.

First reason, impressions come naturally from people, they can not have control of it. For example, when people meet with other people, they automatically have impressions of the new people that they are meeting, do not matter what type of people they are, but the impressions naturally come. Second example, people usually move around the country to live or visit, every new place that they are arriving, the impressions come by itself. Third example, during the school year, the students are exploring more about the classes, they even have been not thinking about it, but they already have impressions what the classes talk about, and the students did not can change those first impressions about the classes.

Second reason, the maind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind sends the first impressions to you. For example, when people go to shopping to a marked, they are looking and comparing the prices from other marked. People are having impressions about the prices and their minds are working sending them impressions and also information from the other marked's prices. Second example, people who work on hospital, they are constantly seeing people with cancer, their minds are prepared to make impressions and send them without any difficulty. The type of impression depends how their minds are prepared to react on that situation. Third example, people who come to the U.S from other country normally they are having new impressions, their minds are having a big change. The mind is who make the biggest work to give the first impressions and adapt to the new type of live.

Third reason, people are not prepared to the first impressions that they have during they are discovering new things, it come by itself. For example, when people go to the cinema to see the new movie about the world, they do not have any idea about what is waiting for them, they just infer that the movie is about the world, but stating the movie they start to have impressions. the impressions come without notice them. Second example,when people got 18 years old, they are not prepared to do everything by himself, they start to have impressions on how hard if the life outside with more responsibilities and without their parents. Impressions always surprise people because they never prepare for it. Third example, people who are starting new job, they are learning how to do it. They are having impressions how the job is, they were not prepared for those impressions that they are having during they are learning the new job.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change, because first impressions are naturally from the people, it come instantly as result of a new thing that people learn. And mind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind is who send the first impressions to the person. Also, people are not prepared to the first impressions, it come as a surprise. People just explore new things and impressions come as a result.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0
DA26E5E2C08E,"Many people believe that teenagers should have a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays and during mindnight weekends. In my opinion I say having a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays for teens that works and get out of work late might not be a good idea. Another example can be, you never know when an emergency can happen at your house and or anywhere else and you have no one to pick you up or an emergency hoccurs at your house and you have no one to take you, at least you got your son/daughter to help you out. Lastly during high school is when you get a lot of projects to take home and when you have test the next day and a project due before that can be a hand full and it can stress them out, by letting them do their work and have more time to study, it improves their grades in school and they do better in their classes.

I have a lot friends that as soon as they get home they get ready to go to work, and most of them come out at 10 p. m but by the time they get home it can a little more passed 10 p. m depending how far their job is from their house. Many teenagers help to support their family in whatever they can, having a job that can help them support your family is truly a good help. Letting your son work passed 10 p. m is not something you want to get in between due to thier boss changing their schedule sometimes and if hes helping you out by giving you money to pay a bill or to go buy food for the house it's worth him/her working a little late. I have friends that work very hard in school and after they home they change, they put on their uniform and they go to work to bring food the house due to his mom not getting payed good enough at her job. Others work to buy themselves their own needs, for exmaple when they have school dances and you need to buy a ticket and your mom has no money, by working you can buy a ticket and attempt to the dance. Another example is prom, prom can be one of the most exiting activities high school has, but it can also be very expensive if you have no money and your trying to look nice and presentable.

You never know when an emergency can occur at your house and you have no one to call or help you out. I once had a friend that his mom was pregnant and he had little sibblings that could not drive but him, and as the pain started to get worst he took her the Hospital and thank god everything turned out fine for them but the reaon they didn't call anyone else for help due to the fact they we're new in the city and didn't knew anybody and it was passed midnight, so his older son carried her to the car and drove her to the Hospital. You never know when an emergency can happen to you or someone in your family at anytime. Another example was when my dad and I drove to Walmart to buy my mom some medicine because she had a bad fever and a headche and we left the house exactly at 10:30 p. m and when we got back home we gave her medicine and the next day she felt a lot better.

During high school is where I have gotten a lot of projects that are hard to make and thier due two days later, not only do I be having projects, I be having homework from all my teachers and test that I need to study. Staying up late to complete your work can most definately help you complete your work or at least do more than what you couldn't had finished if you were to sleep at 10 p. m. Whenever I have a lot in mind like projects, homework, make-up work and test that I need to study really be stressing me a lot until a point where I feel like i'm being rushed and I can't concetrate right if I have other things in mind that I need to get done. But by having no curfew you can go to bed late, but at least you were calmed about it and you werent rushing into getting it done, when you took your time.

Many people can see 10 p. m curfew as something that should be done, but think about the consequences that it can have for example, not being able to work and help your family because can work passed 10 p. m or you never know when something can happen to anybody at anytime and there's noone to help out, or when you need more time to complete your project that you weren't able to finished due to curfew. Think about many other things that can be done, other things that can help others.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

after school homework clubs would be helpful because students can understand more about what they are doing, for example when a student has difficulty in one of there subjects,and they need help they can stay after school to get a better understanding on what they need help on.

other ways after school clubs would help the students focus more on the certain problems they need, but over all after school homework clubs is a great way for students to express there knolage and there concern on what help they might need help on over all.

after school homework club can help know the children strength and weakness for example me when I stay back for math after school my teacher helps me know what I need to work on to decrease my weakness for instance, me and my math teacher she helps me go throw steps to learn easy ways to decrease my weakness in different problems that I dont understand. other ways she helps me on to decrease my weakness is by giving real life problems and showing me ways to solve them and getting the questions right .

having after school clubs can help teachers and the students know were there strength and weakness are.

the after school club can help classmates have one on one conversations on what they understand and do not understand learning from other people can help you because they might know problems that you dont understand but they do. like for instance my friends at my school they get more help from classmates then they do teachers.

If there is a problem going on with your life you should always try to solve that, and do your best to solve it. If you don't do anything about the problem it is going to effect your life even more. So you might as will do all you can to do something good that can solve the problem. For example someone comes and bullies you everyday, and if you dont do anything about that then its gonna get worse and worse everyday.

When you see a problem getting in your way of accomplishing your goals, you should always stand up for your self and face the problem, and beat the problem so it can never bother you again. Their are many you have to face during your life for example, if there is a someone that always bothers you or bullies you, you should do something about it.

If you had a problem face you there probably someone that helped you a little to solve it. Its always really important to tell a friend or a family whats going on in your life because it always makes you feel better. The reason why it makes you feel better is because when your saying all the problems to your family or friend they kinda have ideas how you can solve it. For example if a bully starts to beat you up then the only people that can help you is family and friends.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. This statement is a really good statement because it really motivates people to face there problems, and get them out of there way. I agreed to this statement because of all the reasons I was talking about in the other paragraphs.",3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
CD99E2D6DBE9,"Hey dear employees.

I'm writing this letter to tell you about some of my characteristics that are needed for this kind of job. I'm a responsible guy, who likes to be able to help the others if they need help in anything. Also I'm a hard worker because I'm constantly doing work, never stopping to do anything else if I'm not do with my work.

First,I think that I'm a responsible worker, because I never stop doing my work until I'm done with it. A lot of people tells me that I should get this kind of job, because I dont like when people are irresponsible and since I'm a responsible worker the rest of employers will like how I work, then they will start to their work just like I'm doing mine. I'm always on time. I'm always trying to able to do all the work and to help the others if they don't know how to do it. If I want to go out and be with friends, the first thing that I tell them is that I have to finish my work if I have time to go out after work then I will be able to go with them, but if Im not done then I cant go, because the job is the first thing that we all should have in mind, then the second thing are friends, free time, all that kind of stuffs.

Second, I'm a hard worker in any job, because I like to demonstrate that I can do the best and any job at anytime. So if you need that type of employee I think I'm the right person, because I will work very hard to finish the job by one day. I don't like to many works to be doing at the same time, so I try to finish one per day so later on I wont have to come and start to do the same work I was supposed to finish the day before. Like I said I like to work hard, to finish everything by the same day. I like to make other people work hard to, not just me, because if we all work hard we are all going to be successful in this job, I'm not trying to be successful by myself, I like to see more people success in life. A lot of employees dont work hard for the job that they have, if they dont work hard, that makes the company or the rest of workers look bad because he doesn't want to do anything. That's what I'm trying to change in this job. I'm trying to get this job because I know that I can help other people succeed, I can make this work by helping others and by working hard every day.

In conclusion. I think this are good reasons why I would be a good candidate to be hire for this job, I'm here trying to get this job, so I can help the others to be good workers and help the company look better, because we will work hard and be responsible to make the best out of the best.

605C1B4CE788,"Today I'm going to share my thoughts about Author Ralph Waldo Emerzon wrote to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest acomplishment.

I would say yes is the greatest acomplishment because if you trying to be someone in the world but you don't have no body to be with you is wanna be more difficult but if you try your best you can make it but if you have like people with you that is trying to help you is wanna be more easy, so I think to be your self in world that is constantly tying to make you something else it's one of the greatest acomplishment.

I would say is true because to be yourself around people that is negative is wanna be difficult. So to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you soemthing else is the greatest acomplishment.

for example

If you just been yourself and you making all that you want, a lot of people they not wanna like that so they wanna try to make you fall, so if you been in a world that is constantly trying to make you else is always wanna be the greastest acomplishment.

if you are in a world that people like you only for been yourself it is good becasue you just been yourself you can make anything happen and if you have a world that is constantly trying to make something else is the best acomplishment because everything is wanna be more easy for you sometimes you have to choose decision and i think just been yourself you always can taje the right ones",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0
126555810C31,"An great author, Ralph Waldo Emerson, once wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on my experiences, I agree with Mr. Emerson. Because in order for a person to grow, that person will have to do an certen task, to help that person reach that goal or goals. There are difference things a person can grow in like: school, career, and hobbies.

In school a person learned skills to help a person in the further such as, wrighting, reading, vocabulary, history, and math etc. A person will learned, how to talk to other people, and how to act, by making friend. Also in school like, community collage, can help a person can also developing jobs skills, for further career.

Another thing you can grow in, is careers. A person can grow in their career by going up their working rank I am currently working at Searchs and I am the supervisor their. At first, I got hired as a cashier. It took me a while, but I got my way up there.

Hobbies is another thing you can grow in. People can learning and practicing skills to help them up prove their's hobbies. One of my many hobbies, is drawing. When I was six, I can only draw sticks finger. I have taken many art classes to help me develop my drawing skills. Now I can draw a human with details.

First having a career in a young age,start work (having a job) and living by yourself. its like middle school and high school switch around youre pranging to live your life as adult instead living your life as teenage. At that age no one knows how to spend money or mange too. money is like water you have then spend it, all gone.

Then the other choice not having a career in a young age,living their life to the fullness plus spending time with family and friends. you dont have to worry so much about paying bills and other things. Your family will support you no matter what happen,you could go out with friend. At this point you could spend more time on studying mostly importation on yourself.

E2687856AA7D,"School districts should not allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Those programs force the students to take summer or evenings courses, don't allow them to take elective classes, or students might not have the time that they need to be prepared for college. This information can help students to think more about their decitions, and have a successful life.

Summer, or evening courses can always be stressful for some students. Sometimes, they will not have time for family activities, or they might not have the opportunity to get involved in sports that they like, which is a good way to spent time with other students. It is also very important to know that students need time to rest, a free time when they can sleep and release the tiredness.

The elective courses during the school year should be available for all the student that wish to improve their knowledge. For example, learning other kind of things can encourage students to think about more ideas for their future, and develop new skills on many activities. Taking away the opportunity of students to choose any of elective courses, and forcing them to complete all the hard classes that they need is not a good solution. That will make students to force themselves to do hard work, which can end up in a failing situation.

In other words, its very important for students to be prepared for college. Also students should have the sufficient time to prepare, and choose the career that they really want. If in case students are not sure about what career they want, four year of High School should be enough time to learn more about carrers. For example, students will have more opportunities to attent college day also, they could go visit, and get information about any college that they are interedted on. Being well prepared is the best key to bulid a good future nad accomplish dreams.

This decition should be made by the school district to eliminate this programs, and let the students have a comfortable schedule for thier everday activities. spending more time at home with family, and refreshing their minds it's better than summer courses. Students should know that getting involved in elective classes is more fun, and bieng well prepared for college is more important. Even though students know it's going to be a longer way, it would benefit them in the future.        ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.5

5902C2E86345,"Is influencing others other even a good? I believe that there are better ways to influence other than just by your own. One other better way is to look at other people and see how they have seceded in life. Another way is to see ones appearance and how they act. Others think differently and believe that your own behavior the the best to influence others.

My first reason why I believe there are better ways to influence other is one will look at other and want to be like them. This will want him or she to start and think on what they want for them selves. Maybe they do not know what they want to be yet when they grow up. So by seeing others and how they have seceded they are going to want to try new things. Looking at others by can also help the influence them by what not to do and learn form others mistakes. This could help them start on the right way. Thats why feel like looking at other can influence others.

My second reason is ones appearance cause when someone sees someone they judge off your appearance and how you act. The way someone else looks will want them to be like you if you are dressed with a suit and tie. That is because a person that is dressed sharp or elegant makes you look prfecinal Also seeing others the way they act can influence others to want to act like them. They might see how other act towards them and them probably want other to act the same with him or herself.

Others think differently and feel that your own behavior is the best way to influence one another. Some people might believe this because one person could impact one person so much that it will want that other person to do the same. I feel like that not the best way cause its hard for just one person to do so much. I feel like one person can not do as much as many other people can.

Therefore,this is why I feel like there are better ways to influence others than your own. Like notice others and see how good they are doing in live and might get inspired. Another is a way one looks to someone or they way they are as a person. Others might think the opposite and say that ones owns actions it the most impact full way on other people. This is why believe that one persons actions is not the best way to influence others.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0

BB7BD362A162,"Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week day to be able to save energy and resources with the ten hours each day. My school is also considering to adoted this model. There are benefits and disadvanges that school shall consider. Students, parents, teachers and other workwers members should also give their opinion abouth this new model. Their opion is very important because they will be working for an extra two hours each day but they will also have one more week day free. After school hear their opinion then school should make the decision about adopted a four-day work week.

In my opinion as student I could said that this is not a good idea, because we will have to stay for an extrea two hours in the same place which would not be good for students, be at school for 8 hours is hard for us and I could not imagine be there for a longer time. Although we will have an extra day for be with our family and do homework or any other assignment but whatever we still do all those things with the two day we have now. Shool should also consider that some teachers and worker members have their kids and they cannot be with their babysitter for a ten hours. They need to be with they family after school and do others things. Stay for two more hours will be very stressful for everyone.

School will use the same amount of energy, because they will be using a energy for two more hours each day which is equivalent if they reduced the five-week day to four-week day. The same amount of energy will be used in both ways. Make a new change will afect not only at school it will also afect society. Everyone is adapted to the sistem as it is now if thre is any change there will be needed new rules for example what students will be doing two more hours in school or what we are suppose to do with an extra free day during the week. If students have an extra day doring the week will not be beneficiary, because they can use these time to play video games or spend their time doing things that are not good for them.

If school approved the new model they will need to raise the work's wages for the two more hours of work in each day which will count as over time, because the legal hours per day for a person should work is just eight hours. In fact they will be paying more money compare to the money they are paying now. Now they are just are not paying over time. The eschool should not be adopted this new model, because they will be using more resources.

In my opinion school definite should not adopted the new model, because there are more disadvatanges than benefits. If any other school have not done before is because it is not good for students. The new chage is not neceessity for our school. The same energy will be used and there will be more resources used. For some businesses might work but it wil not work for our school.

B2919590BDB0,"I do agree with Prime Minister Winston Churchill. My first reason is because most of the people in this world will think that is really easy to be successful, but time will get difficult as you and your self are growing up, for you to be failing over and over again is just a meaning that life at some point will be easier, Most people if they keep failing they won't know what to do, Keeping your hope and thoughts on your mind that's how you will succeed. keep on following that dream no matter how hard time will. Sometime you will feel like you're not getiing answer or at least a signal.

My second reason is that failure is going to come at some point in your life for example; teenager come at school, adult come at work, money wise, housing. failure is something that we all should learn how to over come that problem we should think for a solution make a plan in our life. how are we goinf to fix this part and find a solution to over come that problem if we need help from somebody.

My third reason is that as soon as you over come failure you start learning thing about themselve, that they didn't know before, most people find ways to stop going back failing, that's when you start gaining the believe on keep going on practicing every single method to do not fail again.

In my conclusion most of the people have those hard time and is bext to talk to someone about a look for answer, in way to find the solution and fix this problem by yourself or with someone important in your life.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5
E25FE9E05F36,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. There is a lot of benefits of having a positive attitude which are health or physical improvements, how to solve a problem, and the power that exists inside you.

The benefits of optimism extend beyond stress relief better health, more rewarding relationships and enhanced productivity. People with a positive outlook tend to experience are reduced incidence of depression, lower stress levels and are better able to cope with stress causing events, an incresed life span and overall better health. People with a positive outlook on life are also more likely to live healthier lifestyle, and to smoke cigarattes less and drink less alcohol.

Attitude is the way taht we behave and we react to the daily activities, consequently a positive attitude may influence our life and it aspects in a deep way such as how we think, socialize, and even how our health is. All these aspects might be affected by a positive attitude. Actually it is proved that successful people have been influenced by the way they see the circumtances in their life. In other words, successful people see those circumtances with a positive attitude and they see those circumtances as a challange to beat and not like a punishment to suffer. Therefore, these people will be more likely to fight and have success in their life, rather than the ones who see their life as a punishment. Positive attitude might be the key to all the people who want to fulfill their dreams. If everyone would apply these concepts in their lives, they would become happier because they will see that everything including their life, situations, and problems, is under their own control.

Even though there are some people who wonder how to get a good positive attitude, is not simple to get it. Almost every single person that has has a positive attitude is because tehy have had a motivation or a feeling that supports their fight to reach their goal or achievement. When you have a positive attitude, you feel that there is a power inside of you that motivates you to do something or to get involved with something. These people are most commons to have best attitudes of this world.

Having a positive attitude can lead you to the lighter, braver and stronger way to stand against negative attitude.          ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
B68C62AB1515,"Careers are a big part of a person's life. People can choose from thousands of careers that interests them. Careers usually tell a person's personality. A lot of people take careers very seriously and want to know more about careers. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like, they will find something fun to do everyday, and they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives.

Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like. Some students lack information about becoming a doctor. Students often don't know what it is like to become a doctor, or know the basics. In order for students to obtain information and knowing how to treat a patient, they need to experience it physically. It is a good idea for students to take action in a career because they will get more information about it. In addition to knowing what is like to become a doctor, students can look up a career they want to know more information about. For example, if a student wants to know more information about dentistry, they can easily research what do you need to do to become a dentist. Students should engage in a career early because they can find a lot of resources to get there.

A second reason students should be in a career early is because they will find something fun to do. Most students don't really do anything after school or in their free time. The students who don't take action in doing anything, will more likely become miserable and bored. For these students the only thing they should do is join in after school program that helps and educates students about careers. Students should be involved in a career at a young age because a lot of students don't know what to do in their free time. Also, students don't really have a hobby they can do. Students sometimes don't really think about having a hobby that can keep them happy. Students can find that hobby by taking part in a career and actually find something that really interests them.

Students need to be in a career at a young age because they will find something that is important to them.

A final reason students should commit to a career early is because they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives. Most teens don't know what they wanna do later on as they become adults. These people usually struggle in finding a job, and also getting that job. If a student spends extra amount of time in school reading and getting information about a career, they won't have that problem later on. In fact they will easily know what they want to do. Students who get into a career at a young age won't have any problems in finding a job later on. In addition to finding a job, students as they get older won't have any stress on what they want to be. When students graduate high school they are pressured in finding a job, which makes them really stressed. Some students aren't as stressed as others because they already know what interests and them and what they wanna be.

If a student who doesnt know at all what they wanna be, they should spend lots of time on researching and attending career based programs to give them an idea or two on what to be. Students should part of a career at a young age because they won't be as stressed.

Some people firmly believe that students should not commit to a career at an early age because they arent well educated about a career. Unfortunately, these students are more likely to have problems later on when finding a job. In order for students to fully know about a job is to take part in a career fair or just overall being in a career so they can be sucessful when doing so. Students should commit in a career early because they will be more educated in a career. In addition to, they will find a hobby in their free time. Finally they won't have any stress or problems later on in finding a job. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5
39B3FC0EAE2A,"Imagine being a loner for the rest of your life because you only relied on yourself. This quote says "" think about the benefits working with a group or working alone."" Working alone helps you complete what is task to you with no distractions, and creates an important skill to be independent. Working in a group helps with your commutation skills, and each person has their own role to play in a group, so it's less stressful. Although, working alone is more beneficial, actually, working with a group is best beneficial.

Those who believe, working alone is more beneficial have a point because you don't need to relay on anyone. You have more control on what you're working on, these are also your own ideas not anyone else. Working alone keeps you concentrated on what you are working on. For an example when you're working alone it's less likely to get distracting by someone. Working alone can develop independent skill, this skill is good to have in the future. In reality no one is there to hold your hand and guide you. The benefits working alone are completing your own work with your own reasons and less distractions.

However, the benefits on working with a group helps to get the job done faster. Listening to what others say is great listening skills; people like when you listen to them. In a group you can combine ideas and relay on each other. For an example you're confuse you have your group to explain to you what you need to do. This benefits your commutations skills and willing to speak up when you don't understand something. There is nothing wrong with reaching out for help, it shows you want a better understanding on the topic. Working in a group also has an advantage in speeding up the possess since each person is working on what they're assign to. Everyone has their weaknesses and strengths, the goal is to find what best fits for everyone in your group, so you work together as a team. If you make a mistake you have your group to give you feedback on what you should work on.

Additionally, working in a group can reduce stress because you're only focus on one part on what you're working on. We know projects, assignments, etc..can be really stressful, all you have in mind is "" I have to finish all this.""

Working in a group isn't so stressful because everyone has their own role they're working on. Everyone relays on each other to finish their own part, so they can finish faster.

In conclusion, working with a group is best beneficial because you finish your work faster and its less stressful than working by yourself. You can learn new things by working with others, also it increases your communication skills. You can also help one another by focusing on their weaknesses and giving feedback. Therefore, this is an important experience to have because in the future you'll have to learn to work with one another at any job you apply to. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5

But you have to work hard a school dont get introuble at school and not have a bad record so you can accomplish to graduated from Hight school and Collage .In my opinion is worth it be in school for seven hours to pay atention in school cause it will help a lot in your future .The second thing I would like to accomplish is to learn French because that's one of the lenguage I'm intersted on because I like French culture and I feel that French is an easy lenguage to learn because its similar to Spanish and I would like to have the opportunity to know three lenguages (Spanish,Inglesh and, French) and if you know more than one lenguage you can help another people at school and you can also get paid more on your Job .The third thing the I really want to accomplish is to help my parents when I'm older I really want to do this have been with me all the time ,they are been such a good perents I know the they probably wont need my help but I really want to accomplish this goal for many other reasons one of them is because this is coming out of my heart.

6E70CECCE25D,"One topic is frequetly debated is whether or not should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? some people think that because students can learn more. They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more.

One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and don't distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they don't listening to the teacher while she's explain. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she don't say anything when we are using our phones.

Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read.

Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they don't have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and that's one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i don't have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and that's why i don't do your homework.

The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases.

In conclusion why the school days can extending two hours is because most students want to stay in the school to participated in activities of the school or participated in some football teams.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

Although some students will don't want graduate early because they are not ready to being a university life or alone life, nevertheless for others students is a good choice being her life or overtake her life, for example they have more opportunities for study a long profession like Doctor, students will have more time to doing think they like as to travel, and if they want can make a family.

Students make a complied because they want to study a long profession and they don't have some many time to doing all thing they want. The students said normally the people finish high school between the 17 or 18 and they know are young, but some time they need a break before to enter the college and if one student want to study a long profession he or she don't have so many time to take a break and study a profession like a doctor than is during like

9A36D8AB4818,"Community parks provide a lot of fun ways to spend time outdoors. One of my three favorite ways to spend time outside would be playing sports, gardening and exercising. It's a productive way to spend your weekends.

First, Playing sports outdoors is very fun way to spend the day. You can play with your family and friends. You learn about communication and teamwork while playing sports. Communication is a life skill that is used everyday. You'll always talk to someone weather your saying good morning or good night speaking is always needed when talking to someone. Teamwork shows you how to value players on a team. Knowing your teammates worth and dreams is always a great way to start a lifetime friendship. Playing sports outdoors is a great way to spend your time.

Next, Gardening is a way to help out plants and to have fun. Gardening or watering plants gives the plants energy. Gardening may be done with family and friends. Your spending quality time with those around you. Buying seeds and planting them helps out the plant world by giving them new places to live. You may fix up the parks gardens to make it look nice. You don't lose anything from watering plants. Cutting grass or cleaning up around the neighbor hood is a good thing to do. Your doing a favor to your neighbors and nature. Gardening is a relaxing and fun way to spend your day outdoors.

Finally, Exercising isn't done by many people, people just want to spent time indoors and just watch television. Exercising is very important for humans to do. An average human is suppose to exercise three times a week. Going to the park and going for a run is a great way to exercise. Your loosing body fat and building up muscles. You may see animals and plants while your running. You can also exercise with your family and friends you don't have to exercise alone. Exercising is very relaxing and it's helps with blood pressure.

5CB186BF742C,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others, but the use of the technology had cause negative effects on people's lives because, people spend time on video games, people became antisocial, and it is less helpful.

First of all,

people became addictive playing video games, and they spend to much time on it. Video games take you out of contact with others. With the use of technology daily affect people's vision, with the time people use glasses.

Secondly, people became antisocial with the use of technology because, people prefer to spend their time on the internet than having a conversations with their friends. People use to have communication with others by the technology instead of hangout or doing any activities with them. The majority of the people prefer to shop online, and lost their time thinking if the clothes is going to fit them, instead of go to the store, try the clothes on and see if is a good idea to spend the money.

Finally, the use of the technology is less helpful and have a negative effect on people's lives because, the technology take people out from the real world, for example if people shop online and they have questions they have to wait to long to get their answers, but if they were at the store a worker would help them. The use of the technology affect the communication with other people.

In conclusion, technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others and it can be faster; however, the use of the technology affects people's lives, and the communication between two o more person. In my opinion people should use less technology, and enjoy conversations with their friends and family.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
5335796068E8,"Students should commit to a career in high school, because they would get a better understanding about the career they want to do by the they are out of high school.

Students would know what to do after high school. The student wouldn't worry about what job their going to get or what collage they want to go to. They would have everything figured out and it would put less stress on them. For example, If you already know what you want to do it would be easier to apply for collage and you could get a part time job in the career that you chose.

Students would know a lot about the career they want to do. In high school they could research things about their career like how much they pay,the conditions they work in, and if it takes a lot of work. They could also talk to people that are in that career and take academy classes. It would make it easier for the student because they would be well educated about the career. For example, when they apply for collage or a job they could say that they've been studying and have a better understanding of that specific career. It would give them a better chance in getting accepted or getting the job.

It would be easier for the student to get a job in the career. The student would have a better chance of getting a job in the career they want to do if they have been learning and taking classes in high school. They would be prepared and wouldn't be scared of not knowing what to do when they get the job. If the career they want to do requires them to go to collage it would be easy for them to pass the classes because they would know mostly everything. For example, when they apply for the job they could see that they finished collage which would give them a high chance of getting the job.

6792C2E73B6A,"Some people agree with the statement ''success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' because the failure help to learn how other's to be prepared and better understanding. But many people disagree with Churchill's for the reason what they don't believe in the failure because if they fail something they do better the next time. Since, no one is perfect everybody have something bad and something good this don't make a different the other's.

Although many people concern the failure how something the need due for doing a better person in the life but that does the means they can't due. Some people thinking what the failure is important for they life because they learning a new things and they put all of they for doing good person. Clarity, this people due everything for not failure something.

Additionally, many people don't believe in the faillure they say is somenthing happed in the life for doing a better person. If they fail a class or don't pass the class they keep trying and never give up. Surely, with failers they learn from the expirence they will not loss the enthusiasm.

Ask you can see failure is not always a good way to major sucess. One need to success failure is put a attention and due a better person and trying hard. If this people trying the things wiil be better in they were doing. Although all many people are success with failure.

Truely, failure is part of life and we need to understand our failers so the we can successed. By understanding our failers learn how doing better and not worry about the failers. Since they are worry about the failers one can have more enthusiasm to success.        ",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5
9DDBBA28EBD0,"I agree with Michelangelo's words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we aren't not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them.

One good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. When he told me that I thought that wasen't good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. I didn't accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out.

Another reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasen't getting it any more. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didn't have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob.

Also another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didin't whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasen't good enought so i decided to not join the team. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team wan't it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy.

And won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them.

In conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelo's words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5

Achiving more than yhour goals can get you farther in life, it can make your job or what you like to do exciting, and your education expands.

If you think you cannot do it, you are not beliving in yourself.

In order to achive your goals and be happy, you have to belive in yourself first.

Put yourself to do more than what you expected.

Being successful meaning get further in life, have to do with the majority of the world, what's around you, and what you put yourself to do.

In my opinion,

getting further in life is great, not so many people have the privilages to do what you can.

A student once challenged herself by taking chemistry.

At first she did not believe that she can do it but hen she ended up passing the class.

Do not expect less from what you deserve.

Some people do not like their job, so they do a really crappy job.

Making your job exciting is great but, how can you make it fun?

First find something that you like.

Then make a challage every week to be successful, keep in mind that is for the better. Think about it like a game.

Everyone likes games meaning that they would like a challege.

Education has been a big part of ours lives and will always be.

A person can learn from just watching a person characteristics.

There is planty ways a person can learn.

Be ready for any occasion that happens, mentally ready, emotional ready, and even physically ready.

Life is full of surprises and will teach us good and bad things through out the times.

Just be your best and learn from every little thing that happen and will happen.

In conclusion Emerson is right, ""do something beyond what you already mastered.""

A0B2BF94231C,"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone aren't truely who they are. The person can be good looking person you've ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them.

Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you.

Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you.

Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. First impressions can change ,by getting to know that person and who they really are.             ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
5F8195FBA0CA,"Imagine schools use cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes, students will not have a hard time to find information on their classes. Schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom, this rule is important because cell phones are the distraction, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students.

Certainly, some people think cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can have a cell phones' break after finishing their test, they can enjoy some entertainments on the cell phones, some students will focus more on education with the musics on their cell phones. Others believe cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can easily work on the projects, they can search for more information that they do not know much about. Still others argue cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they will help some foreign students with the dictionary apps on the cell phones. Cell phones also help students in classrooms such as: reviewing notes by playing kahoot, some games' apps which include school knowlegdes.

However, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because they are creating an opportuniy for students to cheat on the test or the exam. Students will definitely use the cell phones during the test in classroom if cell phones are allowed. For example, students usually take pictures of the answers and send them to the other students. The second reason of why they cheat is because everything can be easily saved and taken on the little smart cell phones, so why do students have to spend a hard time to study for the test ? They can just easily write down information on their test from the little smart cell phones, so what is the point of education? This rule is definitely unaccepted.

Furthermore, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because the cell phones are the huge distraction. Imagine everybody is sitting quietly in classroom, and suddenly the little noise is popped up from the cell phone, catches a thousand of people's views. Of course no one likes being distracted but having the cell phones during classes is the huge mistake that causes the bad things to everybody around. For example, some students always play some unappropriate songs very loud while everybody else is taking the test, this situation always happens in every school. The second reason is the person who is with a cell phone, can attract the other one who sits beside, and interrupt other students' business.

Finally, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom because they will cause the laziness, lack of knowlege, and procrastination to students. Students will keep messing on their cell phones, and ignoring the education, causing the lack of knowledge. Students will not absorb enough knowledge into their brain because they can just easily search for information on their cell phone without thinking critically of what they are doing. They can have the good results but actually they have nothing in their brain from school. The more schools allow students to use cell phones, the more they are worsening their students.

Cell phones should not be allowed for students to use in classrooms because cell phones are the huge distraction in classrooms, even in other public places, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam using the cell phones, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students. If the cell phones are allowed in every school, students will not need to go for education because everything is available to use on cell phones. Schools only need the real hard working, and the real quality from students, not from websites on cell phones. Every school should always have to think critically about the effects of allowing students to use cell phones in classrooms.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5

Technology has had a big effect on humans from adults to toddlers all around the world in schools and in many other environments. With less communication due to technology may cause conflicts between people. You may have not been able to comprehend what was said or happened because you werent communicating. Not communicating causes people not to understand what you mean or where you are coming from in any situation if its in a relationship or friendship. Communication is something everyone should be comfortable to do and know about.

You dont really get to enjoy life as much because with technology you dont really focus on anything else that is happening around you. When your at family events you may be on your phone and not focusing on your family enjoying dinner, making funny jokes or opening up about something new and important to them. You may be at school and miss on all school events or the kindness of people around you. It does have a big impact on your family because you may care and love them but having technology around really makes them think otherwise.

E3D9EE7C68F1,"Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? They're thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don't like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what's around the world. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live.

The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. Most zoo's can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun.

The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park.

A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven't tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you.

The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. Also, going to the beach in the Bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you will not imagine. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you haven't even tried and that are the bets. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why it's a great idea to go and have lots of fun.

Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. There's different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life. Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have.

When you give someone advice, on what not to do or what to do, they won't take you serious because you're not following your own advice. They'll see you as if you're playing around if you do the opposite of what you told them. That's why a lot of people say ""Actions speak louder than words"". There's a difference on saying things, and actually doing them.

Therefore, there are people who knows you, and want to be like you. You never know if they can come up to you, out of nowhere and ask for opinions and advice. You can't just say anything, you can say something you do, and something you follow. Keep in mind that there's a lot of things people see in you. How you behave can change the way they see you too. Believe it or not, people actually see what you do. If you have siblings, they see your actions without you knowing, and they could do the same things. Giving advice to people is easy, but they would want to see you follow your own advice too.

However some people may think that your character can be influence by which you interact with (like parents), and your personality is based in others personality.

You choose what you want it to be, no one can choose your own way, or in this case your character, is primordial that you choose your own traits, if you don't do that then you'll be un-secure of your self and that can carry many problems to distinguish who you are, or where you should go in life.

Have your own character is a big thing to have, because many people can imitated others character or personality from their parents or any famous person, but if you have you own character that means that you are unique. A recent study in the University of Virginia shows that people who choose their own character and their own way to act, or behave, they are happiest than the ones that imitated other people personality.

You are your owner, your are only yours! Since you are a baby you start forming your character or personality, you have control of what you want to be or what you want it to do. But some people will argue that your parents are whom form your character and they chose your personality traits, but that is not true, your character is formed by your own experiences in life, as Jonh lubbock wrote ""Your character will be what your self yoose to make it.""

4665A1D77D6C,"In this passage i will tell you my point of view of this, I believe that it dosen't matter how much experience someone has over the other person, it only increases there chances of getting picked, and only by a small margin. my reason is that people shouldn't pick a person by what or how much experience they have, but pick the people that are best for the job such as being a hard worker, fast learner, or by being determined to work. you might not have the experience but they can still pick you for the job, all you have to do is to prove to them that you can do learn it and will be able to do after it.

I think getting a new job is like learning a new unit in a class all you need is a person to show you how they do it and improve on that and, you will have setbacks or things that you won't understand. but you will still have the teacher or the person that is helping you, that can tell you if your doing something wrong or to answer your questions. once you had enough practice with it, you can help other people that have the same problems as you or the same questions. by getting the job you've learned how to do those things and how to teach other people how to do it too. you don't need experience you need people with experience to teach you so you can teach other people.

In my experience to have a good worker they don't need to have experience, they only need people to teach them while there working seeing what they are doing wrong and improving on that. while i was working in a construction job, i was making mistakes all over the place, i wasn't doing well with tools or machines, sometimes i would cut the materials too small or too large, so most of the time i would hand it over to one of my coworkers and with the tools, most of the time would get them mixed up, for example one coworker will ask for a tool and my mind would just be blank then they would just get it themselves, so after i had to practice with the tools and by the end of the time i was working there i never got one thing wrong, this proves that all you need is practice during the job or work, it dosen't matter if you have never done it before all you need to practice.

Although i do acknowledge the people with experience have more of a chance to get the job there going for but all i'm saying is that you shouldn't doubt yourself when someone has experience and you don't, just keep your eyes open and your head strong and see if you got the job, and if you didn't, try another time, it dosen't matter if you fail to get the job once or multiple times, it dosen't matter if someone has more experience then you, if you prove to them that you can work harder then them, and learn more then them they will pick you for the job. all you need to do is go to the interview and show what you can do and what sort of person you are.

In this passage i have show that you don't need to have the experience to get the job or being a good worker, you just need to be determined to do the work and they will recognize that, and they will respect you more. but only if you do good work you can't expect good things to happen because of bad results, but if you prove to them that you will be able to learn how to do it then you will get the job. i have also shown my own experience with it of being a worker that had no experience to being the one that never messed up at the end.

6EF7CBB46501,"The statement that the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about to do something else just to be someone in the world, it is completely an error. I disagree with this statement, since, I believe that every person think differently. For example, people has their own ideas and ways how to do their own business. Everyone can make a biggest impact in the world, but, by doing what they love. Not what others think that it could be beneficial for you. To be someone in a world you should believe in yourself, make right decisions, and success.

First of all, people could enter in your mind by telling you what could be beneficial for your life or carer. Some of them accept their opinion and do what they do not like, or love. For example, when students are thinking in what career they want to study. Parents influence in their choices by telling about what career would be properly for them. However, those ""properly careers"" it is not in their list of careers they want to study. This action make some teenangers to take that step of let parents choice by themselves.

Otherwise,

they do not help them to mature or even take responsabilities. Everyone should believe in themselves by doing whatever they love, without any interpose in accomplish their dreams. Since, we have the right to build them, it does not matter if we commit an error. Because of our capacities to avoid them or even get over it and keep going.

People has the right to make big choices in life. Making decisions it is hard and important because it could be beneficial, or even worst. However, if you choice with your heart it might be right but by the time you can change your mind. But, you won't regret it about those decisions because as they say, ""You have to learn for every error you commit to be success."" This means that we learn through the past of the time every fall, because you have to stand up and continue your life. It helps us to growing our knowledge to build a better version of ourselves.

Finally, by being confidence to yourself helps you to surpass any obstacle. Beliving in your ideas and trying to make it come true, it tells us that you are persist person chasing for your dreams. Which is quite favorable for person in any career or even job. Because of seeking to be successful at your own way, by do not depend about what others can say. Everyone has a differently perspective than others by doing what you love without any ""obligation"" or to be oppresed.

In conclusion, I am not accorded by this statement, since, we have different points of view. However, I believe that every human being can make their dreams come true without any oppression by others. People should stand by themselves by starting to be confidence in their belief. Also, by being patience on making important decisions, since, everything takes time. And, do not be afraid on doing what you love because it brings you to the way to be success.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5
94C1C9CD10B7,"'If the school adds one hour and thirty minutes in a schools day'' honestly i dont agree nor disagree their some pros and con with this topic. The pros are that you learn more its good because schools get out earlier for the summer so their more summer days to enjoy. Another pro is if you have question on your homework the teacher can help you out by teaching you and you dont have to worry about the time because you have plenty of minutes to learn. Second If their were longer classes kids will lean more things and pay attention,if its their favorite class well it will be good for them because its longer. For me I love music class if i have more time in that class i could learn more things about music and i could be better player. Third pro it give us more time to hang out with our friends because your could be busy because they sports or church. Well for me i cant hangout with my friends because i have strict parents they wont let me get out of the house unless i have good also they don't let me hang out with friends so the only way i can see them is at school. Fourth pro is you can get to know your teacher and the students in the class you can learn many new thing about the teacher that you would never know about sometime its cool to hear their story because it could teach you something or can make you laugh. So i learn that their many good thing of having more time in a school day.

The cons of having one hour and thirty minutes in school day. First con is kids will be tired and they wont think that much or pay attention because all their energy is gone. The kids will be rude and wont do anything because they are tired or hungry. Well the only way to fix this to give them snack yeah that could help but how your going get the snack you have to buy them with money they are going to tell the kids to buy the snacks and the schools wont buy it. Second con is if the kid has doctor appointment they will go and the next day they will miss a lot of stuff in class and they make it up and the teacher wont teach it again because they have to move on and learn something new. Third con is classes will be harder because you have remember a lot of stuff for the test that your going to have that week. Honestly for me everyday when i get home i take a nap if dont have that nap i will be mad all night so many other kid could be just like me when they dont get a nap they are really rude so that bad for them ant the teachers also you will see kids falling asleep and teacher will yell at them. So i learn that their many not so great things of having more time in school.

In the end they are many good like getting help for work and their may bad things like getting tired. So having more time in school is good and bad .    ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0

3FE7AF072783,"Soccer has always been the most important priority in my life. It is not just a game but a whole different world for of its own. In the other hand, education has been also an essential part of my life. Living in a world full of competitions and challenges needs so much of a person's will power and hard work then just having an outstanding goal and not working on it. Business is something devastatingly related to education and hard work but sports are also a type of business that most of the people do not observe it.

Lionel Messi, the greatest soccer player of all time, is the person I mostly want to meet. I have always been fascinated by your skills and finishing in the field. Every teenager changes their goals for their future at least 5 times, but I have had this dream of being the greatest soccer player in the world since my first year in middle school. I can assure Messi that if he takes me to the Barcelona's beautiful stadium, I will do my best to show him how serious I am to be the greatest soccer player. I believe Messi can select me to show the true feeling of being the greatest soccer player and to let me see the most beautiful stadium of their team because soccer has always been the top priority in my life, it is not just a game but a whole different, beautiful, and unbelievable world for me, and soccer is the only game that I can play all my life without any regrets.

It was the first year in middle school that I actually understood what soccer is. Since then I have been in love with soccer. I lived in Generic_City and my parents are Asian; that is why I have had quiet some obstacles during my life because any Asian parent wants their child to study, study, and study. I was always against those who thought that sports cannot be a true career and business. I never gave up; although my parents told me hundreds of times to work on your education and study hard, but I kept it all balanced and I didn't let my parents know that soccer was always the top priority in my life. Soccer teams and opportunities in our school is important, like working hard and getting into JV was really important for me, and I will surely work hard and do my best next year to get into varsity too.

Some people believe that soccer is just a simple game which anyone can play when they have free time and have nothing to do. I totally disagree with that concept. I believe soccer has its own world. It can be a professional career and it can be a brilliant way to earn money for those who works to earn money. The first day I watched Messi's video on YouTube had me surprised that how can a person be so magnificent at controlling, dribbling, passing, and shooting. He was just perfect. There are hundreds of soccer players out there who have unbelievable and outstanding skills like: Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Neymar Jr, Mbappe and so many more.

Did it ever happen to you that you have played for hours and hours and your mom calls you to come home saying, ""it is enough"", but you feel like you had just started playing 10 minutes ago and how did the time went so fast? It is always the feeling I have when I play soccer. I never get tired mentally while I do get tired physically after 3 hours of playing. I want to play more and more and that feeling never gets old. That feeling shows how much you love the action you are doing. Money is one of the most crucial thing to survive in this world but if I had to choose between never ending amount of money in my bank account and freedom to play as much soccer as possible, I would gladly choose soccer.

Most of the time my imaginations are so nice that I just do not want to move and ruin it because all I imagine is me playing in professional soccer game and millions of people being my fan and I have all the skills that I wanted to have. Imaginations are nice but in real world we have to work real hard and with passion to achieve our goals. Although most of the people believe that soccer must stay as a game that anybody can play in their free time, but I completely disagree because soccer is a complete professional career for anyone who wants to play. Anybody in this world can be the greatest soccer player but the key is to work hard and challenge yourself every single day to become better. No one is perfect that is why we have to practice all the time to be better person in our lives.",4.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5
20E194B18D0E,"The debate was using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some people think using cell phones in the classroom is not good because as soon they grab phones, they will start texting their friends. Some people feel that using cell phones for educational purposes is a good idea because they will do their work. I believe using cell phones in the classroom will distract students, they won't pay attention, and they will stop working.

First reason why using cell phones will distract students because they will listen to music. They will start using Snap chat, Instagram, and Facebook. When my teacher tell us to take out your phones, the first thing I do is to text my friend. I don't like using cell phone because I'll get lazy to do work. Without using phone I have responsibility of doing homework and classwork. One day we were doing a group project, so one of my partner was using phone and he was listening to the music. The teacher told us to share it with the class and give some more details while explaining. Three of us did what the teacher told us to, but the guy who used phone, he had no idea what to do then he got F for that assignment.

Second reason why students should not be using cell phones because they won't pay attention to what the teacher is saying. It will create a big problem because teacher will get tired of explaining and none of the students will listen to her. Even I will stop paying attention because I will start watching my favorite TV show. Only few students will pay attention because they must have their parent's pressure, without that I can guarantee that no one will do what the teacher is telling them. Without paying attention to the teacher while she is giving instruction for the class will make students fail the class.

Third reason why school should not allow students to use cell phones because they won't do their work. If I know that I can use my phone then I won't do anything because I get too lazy to do it. Without doing homework or classwork students will get F and it will harm them after graduating high school. When I was a junior, I was using my phone in the chemistry class while doing a lab. By mistake I dropped chemical on my phone then I lost my phone because it stopped working and when I went home I told the whole story to my parents, they got mad at me. They said, ""how can you be so irresponsible and why you used your phone while doing a lab thats why you have bad grades in the class and so on.""

As you have read, using cell phones in the classroom is not a good idea because many students will stop working. They won't do anything because students are addicted to their phones. Using cell phone is not beneficial because we lose the ability of working and focusing. Using phone won't make anyone smart, if they focus on doing work or listen to teacher that will make them smart and responsible people.

Next, to be honest a lot of success can harm you because they can'tcontrol them self and invest their money anywere like in casino in Alcohol,Druges, and all that can harm your feature like your kides gonna be have so much money he will get everything what he need sport Car, nice House, so he will think i dont have to do anything he dose'nt have the stress on his mind to do somthing in life in small age he will smoke Cigrate and Drink Alcohol.

Then, if you control your success in right position your feature gonna be amazing like obama he is the Presedent of United State of America he have a so much power in his hand to do anything, but the most important thing is he know how to use that power he have big coltrole on his success he also have lot of money,but he don't have any bad habit like Drug or somthing he also made his feature good and he say to his two daughter he say to them go and find work for your self you guys can dependenton me you have to satnd on your legs and show the world what you can do every.

On the other hand, big example of the presedent of India first he was on the street he selling tea and he dose not have enough money to study,but luck is most important in our life his luck chang and he is the presedent of india he did so much stragle and hard work in his life and get success,but he don't have any controle on his success and he invest money on useless things and people in india say he is not a good for

India people hat him he higher the cost of fule,food,elericety,rent and more, and if he had the controle on his success India was gonna be like America.

Finilly, I campare both American and Indian presedent and see the success and failure power in my opinion the United State of America have the success controle power that's why people like to leve there and they also like there presedent,and India dose not have success power that's why people dose'nt like presedent,and they don't want to leve their, so this is the power of success if you use carefully you good but if you don't you die.

3816B67C0B31,"When working alone, I agree that it is more time saveing and benifical because. You are more focuesd and consentradedon what your are doing. So when working on a job or school profect, you can gain experiance on working alone. You are also more indipendent when working alone, and that is helpfull when gong to colleg or getting your first job. Others can distract you and waist your time when working as a group, and you'll end up doing all the work . Ending up with a bad score in your grade. So because of this , people should be able to consetrate on their self , and do their own work alone when the time comes to do so.

First of all, working alone can make you more independent .So when you grow up, and leave off to colleg. Your not going to have any body to leach on, so you should be more consentrated on your self then others becouse. No one is going to want help you on your work. So from being independent, you gain that self confidence, and experiance of working alone. From this you are able to do your own choices. That allows you to get a job, or buy stuff that you want.

Second of all, when working alone. You gain a better understaning on the sudject insted of others opinons confusing you on what to do. Independent work can make you understand what your doing , and get a good score at the end or a higher paycheck if its a job. Other may distarct or confuse you on what the sibject is your doing. For an example, You might be doing a battery replacement on car. you would read instructions on how to do. then see an example on what to do, but from that point. the instructions is diffrent then what your trainer did. You might be confused on what your about to do, and then mess put at the end. Others may tell you that your doing it the wrong way, and distract on what your doing. SO working alone may save you time, and be more consentrated on replacing the cars battery, and finishing the job.

Finally, working alone can make you more focused insted of being distracted by others. You should focus on your own work then copying the same thing as another student. THat student might no bo corect and you are going to end up with the same failure grade as you stident you copyed from. Or when working in groups. Some students may be lazy. Leaving you with no time left, and making you do all the work. Sometimes others may have a different idea on a subject, amking you both fighting over witch one to do. Or some student may be playing around, making lots of sound. making you distracted, and not finishing the work you were supose to do. It is better to work alone because it will help you fous more, and get a good grade at the work you have done.

In conclusion, working alone can save your time, and make you independent on making your own choices. It will also give you that confidence of working independent, so you dont have to ask other on what to do. Working alone is just a good skill to have when you go off into your own life adventure. When you are able to do your choices ehter if its good or bad. You are more independent and responsible of doing your own work, and choices of what todo. ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5

Also that people could never have any complain for having a bad attitude because they know how to control themselves.

Employers need to know that they can rely on this person in rough time. A trustworthy person who can help the team be better and cooperate positively.

No employer would hire someone who can't be at work in time, someone who always finds excuses to stay at home, someone who can't accept to be wrong.

I remember the way I was raised. My mother do not know how to read just because her parents were poor. In my country, Haiti, school is very expensive and not accessible for everyone. But, I had this opportunity because my mother made the impossible become possible. As she always said, '' Je me leve a l'aube du jour et m'endorme apres le couche du soleil pour que tu sois fiere de toi meme, et sois capable d'aider les gens comme moi. "" I graduated high school with advanced diploma. My mother died. She did not have the chance to see the fruit of her hard-work.

I want to make her pride from where she is. Because she was a hard-worker. She is my model. I have known how it felt to be miserable, dependent, be rejected, to count on someone, to fail again and again.

Even though I did not go to college, I am proud of myself. I can read, write, and speak not only one language but, 3 different ones.

I have learned to offer the better side of me in anything I am doing. I will not say I am the ""Albert Einstein'' of this generation but, I am intelligent , fast learner, humble and cooperative.

2623A90F72B9,"Research shows that 75% of individuals agree on Emerson's statement. Well I disagree because you can become better, try is over and over again, and don't bring yourself down.

First and foremost, why I disagree is because you can become better. For example, you mastered a project but you want it better then what you did before look at your project closely. Write on a piece of paper on what you have then plan out your other idea. Don't make it identical make it different. Show people that you can do it but twice as better. So you can be proud of yourself and people can be proud of you too.

Furthermore, why I disagree is because you should try it over and over again. For example, you mastered you project but you challenged yourself to do it twice as better. We all understand to do something better then what you already have can be a little complicated That's why you should try it over and over again so you can accomplish it. That can help a lot to be honest you can see where you made a mistakes and not commit it again.

Last but not least, why I disagree is because you should never bring yourself down. For example, people are getting so frustrated that they will say I can't no more I won't be able to do it. That's bringing yourself down you should remain calm. Don't fell pressured at the end of the day you will do it and you will feel really proud of all of the hard work you did. Dont't ever say never you have to trust yourself if you don't then who will trust you.

This are my three reasons on why I disagree on Emerson's statement because you can become better, try it over and over again, and don't bring yourself down.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
4A9DB943D7D5,"My enjoyable educational activity I chose was soccer because it is a sport you do a lot of running. Soccer can be played all over the world. Long time ago people used to say that all sports were for men only but today men and women play sports thanks to the changing of the laws.

A day before a soccer game, players have to train so hard in order to win. They have to learn new tricks and they have to run a lot. All soccer players must have enough energy to run because it can lead to mistakes and can cause the team to lose. Soccer players need to be concentrating on the ball at all times and they have to make sure where they kick because if they kick too hard, they can hit someone in the stadium. During a game, there has been so many injuries due to running so fast and tripping players and then it causes a huge argument over the injured player. At all times if people want to be a soccer player, they have to play clean.

There are kids that want to grow up to be the best soccer player and for that they have to start early and join a team in a school or in other places that let kids play. Sometimes kids play at their house with siblings or other people in their family and that can be a good practice for a game in your team. Playing soccer is a great sport and it helps people lose weight because of the amount of running.

Some people play soccer for money because they got things to pay, others just play for fun. Some people say that soccer is just for Hispanics, but it isn't true because almost everyone plays soccer no matter the race. In soccer, it is best for your team to have a great coach and that he/she is good at teaching because sometimes its the coach's fault that they lose and he/she starts blaming everyone. Everyone has to try their best in any sport no matter what but its most important to concentrate on the sport and not be thinking about anything else but the sport because you can lose track and make your team lose and your team can be mad at you.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5

9AC838864995,"Im talking about if the school days should be extended by one and a half hours or not and the effects it'll have towards the students, teachers, and the whole school together.

So adding an hour and a half to a school can open a lot of opportunities to learn, more electives, and what most students would think of a longer day at school is bordem, but school is where you socialize the most during the day and as a kid school is where you meet most of your long time friends so there is more then just being bored at school it's a place you can socialize, have fun, and learn all in one day.

If it were up to me whether to leave the school schedule as it is or to add an hour and half to the school day I would have to disagree because if the teachers were to give piles of homework then when you get home you'd be exhausted and drained to the point where you arent able to then even if you did manage to then you would be so tired that it would effect the next day which would cause you to barely do any work in school so the students need to get out of school so they can get their homework done.

If students were to stay at school till 4pm assuming there bedtime is around 9pm then the would basically only have 5 hours to do their homework but wait so then imagine if they had chores to do around the house then once they've done their chores they'd be even more exhausted so after all that they had done what if they wanted to relax a little bit now they have such little time to do anything during their time off from school that they might have to stay up longer then they usually do now it's about 6am in the morning after last night they could barely get a goods night rest and their body and mind are completely drained for today and all they have is good breakfast to get their mind to at least keep them knowledgeable for the day and this whole cycle repeats over and over but then you can at least get a good weekend of relaxing so that you'll be refreshed for the weekdays.

I disagree with the decision to extend the school day because of the effects that it has towards students and how it can effect their mind and how much productivity they are able to produce could be affected due to overwhelming amount of work put upon a child. There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard so they can have the best possible life they can. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didn't have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and that's why the teachers have to relate to the student so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly.

A lot of people have jobs in which they work from home and don't really live the house.

92B8F2F85C44,"Although some say ""Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on my experiences I do agree to Emerson's statement because life isn't easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldn't accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself ""I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way.""

Some say if ""You don't try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow."" How are you suppose to grow if you haven't master something you can't accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesn't mean your going to make the same mistake again. You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. Don't let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions.

Therefore if you can't accomplish something you've tried so much you shouldn't give up but also don't stress about it too much either. If you think what your doing is the best than don't look back and keep doing what you've already started, life will be harder sometimes but it's up to you to show that you can master things you haven't been through. People might think you can't handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you can't just stop trying just because you feel like you can't no more. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day you'll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldn't handle, but not only that you'll be happy because you didn't give up and you showed all these people that didn't beileve in you that you did it!

Others say that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this side of the argument because it's honestly the truth you have to master new things or you'll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you. Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, don't confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off.

In conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldn't end up backing up and telling yourself you can't do it, that it's too hard. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you ""You can do it."" This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I can't master big/small situtions.                         ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.0
E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on people's lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.

24B8DF4DA85A,"Be active or not active in life, those are two options that we have. There is many reason why people are active in life, but there are many other reasons why people stay inactive on their lifetime. Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Staying active and with determination people have more chances to be successful in life.

First of all, in reality things can't be done by them self. For instance, the first TV, car, plane, cell phone, etc... wouldnt be done with out a lot of hard work. Another example could be, the creators of all the things that we have now, they didnt stop or give up on their goals they were active and positive in the process to success.

In addition, in order to accomplish great goals people must stay active and work hard for them.

For example, the best basketball player of all time wouldn't have accomplish all the records with out dedication in the process. Another example, if Martin Luther King didn't do things or stayed back with out doing anything for the people, we probably wouldnt have the life that we all have right now.

Perhaps most important, people have more chances to success in life if they stay active and working on good things, more than if they stay inactive. For example, a hard worker business man probably have way more success in life than a regular person that instead of working hard and do things prefer to stay back and be inactive.

Some people argue that, inactivity serves a purpose. They say that, the fact that people are doing something doesn't mean that what they doing is right. This might be true; however, inactivity wont take people anywhere but to fail in life, and for success in life people must to do things constantly and dont give up.

Without dedication and work people wont accomplish nothing, no matter the talent or the skills that they might have if they dont do nothing with it. People must stay active and fight for what they wish and want, without that life wont take you anywhere.",4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

I want to tell about my friend Generic_Name that he is an engineer, he use be one those people that they think they can't do any thing in lives to find the way of success but he went for it to get it, thats way he is an excellent example for me. That makes me feel like it is your life, it is your choices just find it out whatever you want.

I think whoever believed to themselves and to the ability that they have they defiantly feel more strong in there goals. Also every one knows that when you have a problem do not complain just ask for help like me, when I was in Tenth grade I had a lot of issues the most important one is the school that I don't want to be in school because I feel that is just not going to work for me but I was wrong because I did ask for help from my teachers they provide me very helpful in formations. Some people might disagree with with me because they think asking for help can't solve all of the problems, but they are wrong because everyone need help no one is prefect.

As we know to confide in your self you need to toil hard a lot and you must tolerate more trouble that they are coming in your way. Of cores noting is easy but also is not that much hard that you should give up for it, so the more education that you have the more happier you will be in the future like my favorite soccer player Ronaldo he had a very hard live but he did find his goal and now he demonstrated him self to everyone.

In conclusion whoever try to do something in the lives like working hard on there goals, having enough confidence and tried to achieve them they well be successful.

I'm agree with him, because if you take a class like art or computer graphs, you don't really need your knowledge, the most important thing you need, is your imagination. It can help you do better in the class.

first, the different between Imagination and knowledge is you don't need to rember the knowledge, and sometimes people have hard time to remberm. So you just need to think you like to do, and you don't need to follow the knowledge what you learn. I'm that kind of person that don't like to rember things, but I like to do what in my mine want to do.

FF7FE6BD8509,"I agree that first impression is almost impossible to change. No matter what you always want to stand out of the crowd and show the best of you. People are always going to think of you of how you first were when they met you.

The first impression isn't just about you acting in a certain way. Its also about you showing them your character but most important to get them thinking good things about you. I have three examples of why first impression is important. My first example is that Generic_Name want's his parent's to meet his girlfriend. He thinks thats her first impression of how she acts or on how she greets her self toward's them is something his parents are going to be looking at. Most Guys like Generic_Name want their girlfriend to have a good first impression so their parents like her. Then second example is on the first day of school teacher's always want to give their student's a good first impression about them. Either on how they teach or how smart and fun they are or anything so the students like them. Last but not least my third example is when a school goes on a field trip to a museum or to another school. They want to have a good first impression on any other school that's there or anyone one because, you're representing your school.

There are people who believe that first impression by a person dosen't always show how they really are. For example when you're on a date and you might be dressed in a way or talking with a different type of slang. But that dosent trully demonstrate that if the first time you guys went on a date. That on the second date you can give a better impression than you did the first date. You cant always judge someone by their appreance or on how they are. Another example is that if you're best friend thinks that you want to be with the prettiest girl in school you might want to step it up and change the way you are. You can change the way you are and the first time you meet her you were rude but you're best friend thinks she will like you if your sweet and friendly. Not everyone thinks the first impression is hard to change.

However,I still believe that the first impression is the most important no matter what the situation is. I also still believe that the first impression is hard to change. Some people are different then others they don't all believe the same thing but in my case it's hard to change how people see you the first time because,after that they are going to always look back at that and remember how you were. You always want people to think he best of you because,there going to be a situation that if they need someone they are going to look for you.

To the people that think first impression arn't important they really are. You always want to show people the best of you no matter what. It dosen't matter who you're with or where you are it's always about showing the best about you so people can always look back see that you stand out in between so many people they will look at you. For example If your getting a job and you have a job interview at a certain time; You either might want to be there earlier then the time they gave you or on time.

You are changing school policy so student that have a C average can not participate in sports or other activities unless the students have at least a B average .I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

The school should make a contract saying that students that have a C average cant participate in sports or activities. The parents ,teacher ,principal ,and the student should sign the contract .The students that don't even try to work hard to get a B average should stay an hour after school to catch up the work they have been missing. the students that don't recognized that what their doing is wrong and they don't get privileges like other students do.

CC8647F0D1E1,"Should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day?

School should not be extended any longer than it already is! Although the school board may think that school should be one hour and a half longer, students and parents believe that school hours should remain the same. I do not agree with the school board planning to add one hour and half every school day. School by its self puts a lot of pressure on the students and with a hour added its going to be much more difficult.

The school board should not add hours to school, since students are already used to the hours they get out of school. With a hour and a half students would probably get to much pressure on dealing with some school material. Students would also get much more school work. They would also get an hour taken away to spend that time with the family. It would also take time for the students to get used to leaving school an hour later! If the school hours remain the same then students would already be used to the hour schedule, and they would also have time to do after school activities!!

Because the school board wants to add an hours more of school, the school board should listen to the parents and not add another hour. It would give students much more stress. Without an hour added, it would give so much relief to alot of parents that wont have to fight for what they believe the school board should do with the time schedule.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0

Technology are use for business their daily lives. Although people's are use technology for helping them to solve the problem. For instance when people have meeting, and they do not know what time is meeting. That time they can use technology to send the email to the boss. Also teacher are use the technology everyday for many reasons. For example to great student test, and email other's teacher etc. In addition some time in business people are used technology person reasons. For example talked to they friend and family. Also some parent live they children at home, and they are use technology to speak to they children.

People's are used technology to contact other people who are live different country. People's are move to different country because of money and have good life. So they have to use technology to talk with they family. Some time people's are used technology different away to contact they family. For example text, email, call, and messages.

F11E6745A8DA,"I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college they'll be ready because thats how college is online.

Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed.

Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. Thats why i agree that we should have online classes because Ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home.

finally, last but not least college. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.?

A0D47C0DD67F,"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Let's be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody else's ideas

In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus' mother). To catholic people Jesus's mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lie's layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the church's hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress people's rights.

In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion.

I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My art's teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it

In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment""",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0
ECCAD55DE7BA,"I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I think it does because it helps us learn on what to do. We can teach other the same way as well.

We have other people helping us in different ways. For example, we can teach them different ways on doing things they don't feel comforable and that they would feel conforable if they keep doing it. Although it may take time to get use to it they would have experience at the end. Also those people can teach other people. Learning new stuffs is hard but if its a good idea people should do it.

I think we can make a difference by learning new things in our lifes. For example, if there were new ways by playing video games then people should learn it. Although it can get people mad if they lose or anything else. It can be helpful to others in the world. I think they would know a lot more if they did.

We would get a lot done quicker if we had a method on it. For example, other people helping out on big protects to make it happen and work every well. Although it would need a lot of taking to one each other. It can help by not getting to one an other. Getting to know new people by doing things.

If your not doing things you won't get anything accomplish in life. For example, if you don't do well in school that can effect your life by getting a job.

disagree with adding one and half hour to school each day because students would get tired and it would be more things to the students have to know.

In our school we have 9 hours of school and if we add it would have 10 and I don't think students want to stay in school for a long time. I get that school is a place where you learn and school get's you a job and you can get a free scholarships to college without paying but at the same time students need 7 hours maximum so they would fit all the knowledge and all the subjects in there mind.

Teachers want students to learn more because they want student's to have a successful life and learn more but student's have less time to listen because they want to go home .In our school we have 4 subjects were we have tests and some students fail it because there studying for other classes even though it's not important like for example,elective classes,I get that elective is important to but students but it's really not important. The important classes are Math,Science and Language arts, and History. The school board is not gonna like when students fail there tests when they have 10 hours in school each day. Students should have time when they get home to study so they can ace there test,Since our school is a Middle school we should have less hours so we can pass 6th,7th and 8th grade without having any difficult in school.

Students wouldn't benefit if the time is longer they would not even pay attention to the teacher so i disagree with having one and half hour to school each day. On the other hand,I think i could agree to this because in order to become successful you have to study and work really hard and get enough to time to do your work.

I think students would go to college if they had a lot of time and students would understand things better we should have a vote where students decide whether we should have one and a half hour or not so then the school board can see which one got the highest votes and they would decide if we should have a longer time or regular time. This year a lot of students are getting bad grades because there is so many tests and works they have to do and it's always do on time so i feel like we should have less time in school so when you get home you have a study time.

The school board will like this idea because being in school for us is so much and there is no point for staying 10 hours in school because teachers would get tired and students will get bored.

7ACF284A8B7C,"I think that work in groups is more benefit. Because work is groups make the class successful. also, the students can know each other and they can meet new people. therefore, work in groups is benefit for students and teacher. Here are some reason why

I think that work in groups is benefit.

First, They can divide the work in same parts. While someone is working in searching information the other one can think in how to make the work more creative. Also, if they divide the work is more fair for the group so they can have more opportunity to work successfully. Second, They have more opportunity to have a better work. If the class work in group they can do much better in the work that working alone because they can do the work more easily by working as a team. For example, If the class works in groups of 4 they can do a good work by dividing the work in same parts like one can be searching for information the other one can be looking for imagines. The other two can be checking that the writing is good and that the information is good. And the last one can make the presentation and make the work creative.

Second, In groups can take less time to work on it that working alone. If a group meet in one place and they start working they can easily finish the work on time. Also, they can search for information more faster then alone because they can divide the work but they can also help each other. Second, In a group decide what to do it can be hard. But when the group decide what to do and they finish the work fast. The group can check if the work is good or not and decide either to keep the information o to make some changes. So, the group can have more opportunity to have a better grade.

Third, Work as a group can also be fun because you are working with your friends or you can met new people. First, work in group can be a good for class because they can know each other. If the class meet each other the class can be more successful. Because there will not fight or enmity so the class can work more successfully. If a class is works more successfully that makes the topic easy and knowing each other makes the class more understanding. And, It will make the class more fun because everyone can help each other in thing that are hard for people. For example, if one student can't understand the topic he can ask for help to the teacher and he can ask to people around hem for help.

In conclusion, work as a group is funny and make the class better. Also, it makes the students to do better workers and meet people. therefore, I think that work will be better in groups because the class can meet and know each other and they can be better person and better students. This are some reasons why a think that work in groups is better.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

I'm writing this letter to you because i think that is better to not allow students to have cell phones at school at all because they might get distract when they have their cell phones and they might use them during class. I think this is better because some students bring cell phones to school and they use them during class and they don't pay attention to the teacher and they are always distract when they have cell phones, some students don't pay attention because they are using cell phones in class and when the teacher ask them a question they don't know what to answer because they didn't pay attention when the teacher was talking. Another thing is that some students are now getting in trouble because they are using cell phones talking to other people that they don't really know and they give that person information about them and about school and they don't really know who that person is and they could be in danger because that person knows everything about them and about the school.

Sometimes students have their cell phones turn on during class and when the teacher is talking the phone begins to sound like someone calling or a message and they interrupted the teacher and the teacher have to take time from the lesson and tell the student to turn on the cell phone or to give it to her.

45E5B6DE09E9,"One of the most frequently debated questions in today's society is whether or not first impression are possible to change. Many people argue that first impression are almost impossible to change. They say that is not possible and inevitable. I disagree with the statement. I believe that first impressions can be can be changed because we cannot judge people just by looking at them, everyone has different viewpoints, and we dont know the struggles that the other people are going through. Words can also hurt!

The first reason as to why i disagree with the statement is because we cannot judge people from first impressions. The way people act or interact is not essential information to see the intellectual development and capacity of those individuals who are being judge. There is a famous quote that says, ""Our words can sometimes hurt even more than a punch."" We all can relate to this, sometimes the words that other people use to express are very damaging and hard to listen; even when is just a silly joke that one of your friends is saying.

Nevertheless, everyone has different perspectives and view points, but just because we may think differently, doesn't mean we have to get driven by our perceptions or speculations. There are millions of people in this planet, and every single one of us think and look different. We are all not the same. The complementary diversity we have nowadays is a great example of this. It is good to have a great range of diversity, but the race we all come from cannot define us, nor the judgments that other people make from us.

The last and final reason is that we don't know the struggles that the other person is going through. Sometimes, we may look tired, weary, or even depressed. Sometimes we are having problems with our families or with our own selves. The judgments we make can potentially affect those individuals life. Sometime we make decisions without thinking about consequences or how those decisions are going to impact others. Decisions, such as the judgments from different speculations we make.

As you have read, I disagree with the statement. I believe that the judgment from our first impressions is not inevitable. We are capable to change our own perception from other people that can potentially affect their lives throughout the struggles that he or she may be facing.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0

I personally don't think its a good idea that your considering changing school policy so that people may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

Sports has nothing no do with school, that's just another activity that's after school and the better you play sports the better your going to be good at school, specially with your grades. It keeps you organized and makes you stay on topic. For people sports are really important and really fun to play, it makes you runs and concentrated on how you play. You might think that for some reason that's why people are getting a bad grade average, but its not like that. I consider that sports are really important to me, and even if i don't play in a team i still love to play any kind of sport. It keeps me awake and motivated. It keeps me from stop being lazy all the time. There are 2 main reasons why i don't think its a good idea that you should change that policy. My first main reason is sports have nothing to do with school ,is just another amazing activity that people would enjoy instead of just watching TV or being on the computer. My second reason is like my mom always told me a story. When she was little and lived back in Mexico, she would tell me all about her childhood and what she would do at my age. She used to tell me that she would run every morning to exercise and breath the fresh air outside, after that she would be with my grandfather and helping him with everything that she could and then she would play Basketball with her friends. Having a little challenge to see who would win and just to have fun. I remember asking her if sports had to do anything with school? if that was an activity to bring my grades up ?' What she said Exactly was "" They invented sports so that kids, teenagers and people would have a routine and be a better person. Believe it or not mostly for teenagers, sports brings there grade up and well organized , and when i started playing sports, it did bring my grade up. What the captains do is that they show you how to be on time and do all your assignments so its similar to sports.''

For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activities or someone in school that is friends with their friends. If you disagreed with the principals decision you would just do the same routine all year until summer has came and then high school and then that will be the similar routine and then graduation and then you've decided to go to college and it's another same routine for how long you're gonna be there and then you get a job and it'll be another same routine until you retire and then you just go home and rest until you die, sure it would be similar if you agreed but sometimes you just gotta try what's new what's been going on or how's it going go out with your friends and then you guys get closer and you've decided you guys wanted to hang out and do whatever you want to do. Sometimes your parents might force you do to some activities at school or outside of school it's because they want you to feel like you've like accomplished everything in life and you've decided to try something new for once and will actually enjoy it and stick to it as long as you live or until you quit or retire.

People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect.

Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way. People tend to do things to hurt the other person online rather than to their faces.

Some people decide to date someone through social media when it isn't a good idea to do. People can fake identities to make people think they're another person. people decide to not say who they really are, so they could either kidnap them or make the person they're tricking to send them money if they live in another country. It's rare that people find someone who doesn't lie about who they are. Some people probably decide to date through social media because they think that they won't find anyone who will really like them.

Most people who have technology now use them to communicate with other people instead of in person. Most people decide to communicate through online or text so that they don't see the person's face. People feel more brave to tell a person something mean or hurtful through text or anything. People just decide to not talk, but instead to text.

8DF5D7CF4085,"Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. Many people don't have the time to accomplish their goal and others have. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. Others like to stay idle or not tend to move to achieve their goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I totally agree to Thomas Jefferson's statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something.

To start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker.

For example, When you are given a task to complete you can't sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete.

Furthermore, doing something always makes you more active. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you can't possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top. Whenever I fail a text, even though I don't like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal.

On the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers'. They say this because most high schoolers' wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but can't stop cause they have been addicted to it. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. And you probably don't know what's going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future.

In a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. It also helps you discover more. It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. It will make you useful in your workplace. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model. You can get the college you have been always dreaming of and accomplish all your personal goals. ",4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

and it makes alot of sense.

and its possible for it to change.

my life was complicated at first, but I always thought of a solution to escape my problems, as when I was little my life was a living hell, I always got laugh at, even if I didn't had a reason to get laught at, so I saw through my life and thought theres was a reason to live anymore, but then I ask people about there life, and they told me everyone love them, and that hurt me very much, so I gave up and didn't ask anyone for help. until one day. one person in my class told me if I was okay, and I responded back saying, ''I want to end my life'' and he in tears, gave me hope and told me if I wanted to play soccer in his team, and I told him, I will think about it, and after the day pass, I became a new member of his team, I practice so hard, his coach saw in me potential and told me I should be the captain of the team, and it made me so happy, I started asking my parents to buy me stuff like food, and stuff I needed for traveling with the rest of my friends, so then the days pass through, and I woke up so bright, I couldn't wait to get ready to travel with my friends, so when I arrive to the school, I started practicing and getting ready to play for the team, then I saw behind me my team with a soccer ball, to get ready for traveling, when we started packing up, we saw this huge bus that was so cool, even a giant could ride in it, so we ran as fast as we could to the bus and I got the first seat in the bus, so my friends got jealous of me, and start throwing papers, but I was so happy I ignore the team and started thinking of the soccer championship, then waste my time fighting for nonsense.

the next day we all woke up and the bus stop us at a food shop, were they sell all kinds of stuff, and I was so sad, I forgot my money, but I didn't forget to carry my lunch, so we all finish eating and came back to the bus and travel again, and traveling we saw through the window amazing places, until we stop and ran out of gas, and stop at middle of the road, I was so mad, I scream very hard, and threw papers, until the teacher told me to calm down, he told we could instead have fun playing soccer at a private place, because it didn't matter if we didn't make it to the league, what matter to are teacher, is to put smile on are faces.",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

When we get home we can only a little time to study and do homework and maybe have some fun. We will be bored in school and be tired cause then we get home we will be tired of all the time in school so we would want to take a nap but then we won't do Homework we wont study or do anything cause we will be tired. Sometimes i have to be home early and take care of my little brothers but if the school board adds one hour and a half hour then my brothers will be all alone.

I disagree that the school board should add one hour and a half hour to school each day because some teachers might have to take care of they're children and they need to take care of him at 3:30 but if the time of the school changes then he will be late to take care of they're children and come 4:30. they would want to quit they're jobs. Get another job then the school will lose a lot of teachers. All the students will be hungry because they got lunch early. Some students will not even go to school they will skip or just not go to school if they're is one hour and a half hour. If students parents want they're sons to be home early but the students cant because they're going to be one hour and a half hour extra so then a lot of students wont be in school then they're parents have to pick them up.

I disagree that the school board should add one hour and a half hour to school each day. Because the students are gonna have to get a second lunch. The lunch ladies are going to say they are tired and cant cook anymore. The lunch ladies will quit. We will have no lunch ladies. We will not eat anything.

I disagree that the school boards should add one hour and a half hour to school each day. Some parents are not going to let they're children go to school if the school board adds on hour and a half hour to school each day. Parents will be mad and sue the school. Also some of the parents will travel with theyre children to another state to another school with no extra time. The school will lose a lot of students.

I disagree that the school boards should add one hour and a half hour to school each day. Some parents want to take they're kids out and have fun but not if we have extra time. A lot of students will be mad cause they will not have fun but have to learn more at school. Parents would be mad because they wanted to take they're sons out but can't because they're will be extra time. So students cant have fun and do more work at school.",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0

Because working with a group is more better have more ideas about of projects, every vary collaborate with the work making all together not distracting with the other students, and all in the group help with the ideas, what work need for the project, what talk about in the work, or what type of project made, what are doing the teacher said with the work.

Sometimes working with a group all have ideas, what are doing first, who make the tittle of the work , of who have the perfect idea of present ate the work or explain with the group what is the best are doing in talk about of the work and projects. when some students working alone is more complicate for sustain with take the best idea sometimes don't likes what are doing with the work. But when the students working together with a group i feel more benefits. Because when take one best decision some students said i like this idea or the others.

Some students like work with other students or not someone is quit not like express the idea or like only with self for example; Working with a group is more benefits work you can express your ideas for make the best work in the class or more best in the other students group some many student when make working alone sometimes catch good score or bad this students don't put penitencion in the class or distracting with cellphone or other things. When making work with a group other explain what are doing, what the teacher explain in the class what type of work make or project.

Working with a group all students feels more benefits for take the good grade for the make all together the nice job: However working in group is try the express the best idea in the group try help other, and one give the best example or make change the students in the group have the best grade to coming up someone students don't turn in the work this is affect the grades this is time to the change the grades for all sustain as making or learn more about what the teacher explain in the class for every vary pass the class.

I disagree because some, kids don't get enough sleep. some kids stay up, late because of electronics, helping someone, or watching TV. some kids have to help their parents, do some work like farmers or cooking. some kids lose, track of time like me.

Some kids have afternoon activities. Some kids are tired of school but if they make, it longer kids would be even more tired. It would give, students less time to take breaks at home. Grades would get worst because, the students get less time to take a break.

BF652DD7B469,"There are a lot of poeple these days that having a bad attiude during a difficult time. Here are some ways to try to have a good attiude during these times.

Getting a bad grade on a test or quiz. Their are kids in middle and high school who study and at times get bad grades. These kids have trouble knowing that they failed their test or quiz. One way to provent this from happen is by having a good mindset. They can deepdown be mad, but if they put tell themselfs that ""i'll try harder next time"" they could do better on the retake or on the next quiz or test. Even when some kids that study a lot and fail some of they overreact during it.

Overreacting is another promble kids have. Some kids overreact by saying ""if i fail this i wont get a job"". Other times kids thing negativly about themselfs and they bring themselfs down. They could be telling theemselfs "" i'm going to fail"" or anything else instand of that they sould try telling them say ""i'm going to try to do my best. They dont know intill they try to do their best.

Having a good mindset can help. Havin a good mindset meaning to think positivly and to know that not having passed their test or anyting in life. That everyone had to start from one place and build on. Other times kids should learn from their mistakes. They might have or might have not fail and they shouldn't put it on themselfs because they could fail if not.

These are ways to provent kids from having a bad attitude to having a good attitude during their difficult time. They should try to be more calm and the should try to not overreact at much. They should also try to have a good mindset during it.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

7E669FF93EB9,"While, some students are distracted others are taking an advantage of it. Although some say that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms. Actually it should be allowed in classrooms,for research purpose and projects during class. by the used of cell phones. We can learn more about any topic, an example of this can be,if the teacher is explaining something and i don't understand instead of asking him. I can go to internet and find out. all the things that i need to learn and with examples. I agree with the assertion of using cell phones in classrooms.

Those who believe, that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms,have their reasons,for example they believe that cell phones are distracted, in a way that students can't control it. They also think that cell phones are addictive. However,that is not true because we all can control our self, and i think that if we use our cell phones in a corresponding way, we will not only learn more, we will improve our skills and in the future become professional in anything.

I believe that we should used cell phones for research purpose,for example i remember when i was in English class i got sick, and i had to go to the doctor when i came back, to school the teacher was giving directions for our next assignment,but in that moment i felt like i was out a lot of days,but no it was only 2 days out of class,so i said to him I feel like i had miss a lot of thing just let me know what i need to do, and i will try to do everything that i need,so he said we went over more vocabulary, but right now i am explaining something, if you want to do it you have to stay after school i will be happy to help you. I said no you don't have to explaining me nothing, just give me the vocabulary i will look it up in internet,and i will write down the meaning of each word i will be quiet,so you can keep doing what you doing. He said fine. If cell phones are not allowed in classrooms, I could not do my vocabulary, and not only that i improved my skills by researching for good information which is not easy. I think that this is a good example why we should used cell phones in classrooms, so we can use them in a correct way thinking about our grades.

I also think that we should used cell phones for projects. This is my friend called Generic_Name he is 17 years old we are friends from middle school. In this time we were in government class, once again the teacher gave us a group activity in this case we had to came up with a new country, otherwise invent country,so we had to give it name,where it will be located, and the rulers for its country. After that,all the students got their own computers,but there were not enough for everyone,so we had no computers next,we asked the teacher can we used our cell phones,for the project she asked if there were no more computers and we said no not more,so with no choice the teacher said yes,used your cell phones,but only for the project,without wasting time we got our phones out,and we started working on our new project we worked in our cell phones as we had computers after the hard work we stopped,because the bell ring. This is another proof why cell phones are important they are really helpful in many different s ways we used all cell phones,for the whole project and thanks to that we turned in our project on time.

In conclusion,we should all used cell phones in classrooms for research purpose and projects. having in mind that a lot of people will not agree,but cell phones are helpful. They are important. technology is here for us,so we can take an advantage, and use it like it is for our own purpose. cell phones will provide a better understanding to all the students in all schools We should reflect about it, and came up with our own position. If cell phones should be allowed in classrooms,or cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5
0EE67777ABB5,"Do you think having a positive attitude would always bring success in life? Always having a negative attitude wouldnt really take you anywhere in life. But, having a positive attitude would bring success in life, because nothing would be in your way to reach your goals you want to reach. For example, the prompt says It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Therefor, being a positive person would bring better life choices in the future.

Agreeing with this statement would represent you as a positive person. Some examples would be, being positive would bring better benefits. This stands for being a nice and positive person would bring new and better things in life. Like, having a better job than the last one would bring you positive energy because your getting paid more than the last job you had. This could lead to always having a positive attitude every time.

Another example for agreeing to this statement would be, a positive attitude could sometimes bring better opportunities in life. This represents being positive could bring good or bad things later in life. In addition, this could be like coming to school every day and being prepared to learn could bring good things in life. Or, not coming to school could bring bad benefits in the future. this would also represent you as a good and caring person or a bad and irresponsible person.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude could sometimes be the key to success in life. Therefor try to always have a positive attitude, life could be hard sometimes and wont go the way you want it to go. That's why you should never give up and think positive of the positive consequences that could happen. Also, having a positive attitude could bring better friendships that could last for a lifetime. these are all my explanations on why positive attitude is the key to success in life.

68256AC96C72,"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age.

Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since they're still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldn't have to worry about what career they want since they're still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life.

In conclusion, i think students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Students can also work in a long-term commitment in a particular profession. Committing to a career can lead to causing mental or emotional stress.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5
3DCF3E6F4A13,"Well most students enjoy summer vacation because was one of the most beautiful station in the year for one all of students, they enjoy with the families, friends that things in the summer, though some teacher say the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall.

I think that summer is one of the most special station or period because you share more with your Family, Friends, and all students have merit to share more with the most important persons in their lives because a lot of our parents working 10 to 12 hours of Monday to Saturday in sometimes Sunday too, and they don't have a lot of time to share with they families.

In my case, I love when it's summer vacation because I have a lot and good experiences with my Family, with God when left to the house our going to different places, I feel that is these period is when I share more with my mom, She is the most important person in my life, she is who are always with me in the good and bad things, she is who give me advice every day about the good and bad things to not make that things that I don't need to do and don't pass for a lot of things that she pass when she was young, I love these time of summer because is when I pass more time with my mom and she help me to be better every day in my School, Work, Church and everywhere that going.

The mother is one of the most important person what I have in my life because she is who always are in there for me and help to always be good person, good in my school and a lot of more things. And I have beautiful experiences with God and these is that I love more is to pass my time with God because I learn more about things important and that help my life.

I think the 2 months that all students have to summer is a good time because are pass like 9 months in school and these is too much because sometimes you want to make something but school is to difficult and that people can't to share with special people.

Well when the educators or teachers say that summer vacation is too long because student do not retain the information is not true because the students retain these information about Works, Projects, Homework, Classwork the information is in our Brain, Mind, are that things important and basic.

I don't agree that person argue should be year-round and that only have 3-4 weak breaks in the summer is like only one month and you can't enjoy and make your summer funny with you parents because you are thinking in school, I don't be agree with these the summer is when you can pass more time with your important person because there is the period when they have the vacation to, I thing the summer is for enjoy and pass a funny time with your Mom, Father, Brothers, Sisters, and all your Family.

I say that is good to have 2 months and like 2 weeks of vacation because you clearing you Mind, you don't thing in a lot of Homework or Works of School. I have one experience in my life when I were in Generic_City that only thing that I have in my MInd was Homework, Projects, Presentations in my School, Programs of my School and one day my family say I want to going to share with all and I say I can't go because I have a lot of work to do and I need to finished and my uncle say Generic_Name is time to share with your family, is time to you clearing your mind about school and I say another time I need to finish my works about school and all my family going to share and I stay in my house working in all my projects of school and I sit in my room, I was thinking you loss beautiful time with my family for to make my works, and I say is time to you share more with your family because your family in every moment stay there.

Everything the specific moment when you have time with share with your family, friends share because you don't not in what moment you can loss your Mom, Father, Brothers, Uncle, Sisters, Aunt, Cousins, etc, when is time to school make all your works in time.

Don't take you Education like obligation, taken like one of the opportunity to be better.

In some moments you have difficult time but you need to continue, to be stronger, the education is where you learn more about the all things Human, Animals, Solar System, H2o and a lot of things important what help you life in the future you learn things what in your future you can put in practice, you can teaches another person that need to know more.

For everything have time, your Family, Works, Friends, School all these things depends about you, for these reason I think When is time to school is school, When is time to your family is family.

So you need to think and put your agenda in order to you make the important things in order so right now I change a lot of things in my life and these it is the Monday to Friday to be concentrate in my Education, Saturday to Sunday in God and my family, when it's time to pass with my family I pass time with my family and now I share more.

And for these reason I think the summer vacation is important because a lot of students don't have their parents in here maybe live 8 hours, 10 hours in when it's vacation they going to pass time with their Parents.

You need to be have the order in your life you need to make time for everything.

The Education is important because is where you learn things important but most important for me is my family because they can one day no be in here in the Earth because they dead.

And I think when it's summer vacation the Educators or teacher enjoy to their vacation and pass good time with their family and when it's time to come back to school review somethings because not everything forget somethings are in the brain that only need to do is to review.

Then the summer vacation are so good 2 months and 2-3 weeks to you enjoy with all the persons important and special to you, so enjoy and pass a funny summer vacation.

So enjoy, teachers don't thing the summer is too long because is a shorter period that one student have for vacation, teacher enjoy vacation!!.",2.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
1214E4605B0C,"Should the school break system be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break , and a week off in the spring. Some educator feel that the summer break is to long and students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Others argue that summer break is for students to take a mid break and stop think about school. Schools should not change the break system, because many students and parents had already planed,what they would do during the summer, and because many students work, and by changing the break system it could affect them, and because summer break is for students to relax, get a mid break and stop worrying about school.

The school break system should not be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the the spring, because many students work during the summer and many jobs do not gives students the opportunity to work only a few week or days,they want students work a lest two months so they can be able to give them the jobs, otherwise they would give the jobs to peoples that can stay more time with them. For example I work during the summer, and the company that I work with, only gives jobs to persons how agree to stay more than two months with them, if the school system change, this clear is going to affect me, because I going to lose my job and it would be difficult for me, to find another job during the break, because most of the jobs do not want people, how just going to stay in the company for a few days or weeks.

The school break system should not be change , because students and parents have already planed , where they going to go, and what they going do, and if the school change the brake system, most of the plants that they had already made it, are going to be destroy . for example my bother and my parent visit my grandparents every single year and if the school break system change this could be a problem because they would have to come back more soon, and probably they may not go.

The school break system should not be change, because students have the right to have a long break and stop think about all those worksheet,quizzes, and tests that ,they had already done during the school period,summer break should be a time to relax spent time with family and friends and not a time for be think and worry about school.

Considering all this factors that I just talk about, I clear believe summer break, should stay the way it's, because it has being working like that for many year.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
918C1880FCD8,"When did you decide to research your future job?

Students should start thinking of a certain career they would want to encounter by the time they reach high school. by the time students reach high school they must have a job they're interested in. If students start viewing the concepts they need, they can become what they want to be. Also by starting early with a goal, researching, and acknowledging goals they can find a job that they would like. Also will have a distinct idea on how to succeed.

First step, In most societies students start researching different jobs at a young age, so they know what they want to become in the future. Research helps students find what they need as a teenager, for example: getting a Standard or Advanced diploma, going to College, and getting a degree. when students start encountering what they need to accomplish they will tend to work hard and start receiving the information they desire. Also research gives a better understanding for the student to know what to find. Although some may say ""Information online may be false"" but there are multiple sites you can examine to observe the true facts.

Second reason, Goals help students with finding a career to start. Goals help by giving an idea to a student of what the second step is, to find the best career for them. Goals can be both limited and unlimited. Although some may say ""Students should start thinking after they graduate high school because there's many jobs in life students might pick the wrong job"", but starting young helps the teens mind to find different careers. Also students can decide what they would want to commit to.

Third reason, Acknowledging your goal will take a very important role of students life's. If students complete their goals, and research they can acknowledge their goal. Examine the work they have finished and look through to check if they are missing anything. After students have finished their steps students may continue on finding a job that they want from the data they collected. Finally acknowledging goals will help in examining job duties.

In conclusion students should start finding a job early. Starting young will help each individual student with, finding a job, how to determine if the job is right for you, and following along with accomplishing every goal. Students will have a less stressful time finding the right job. These 3 steps will help students find the right job: Goal, Researching, and Acknowledging their goals. Also it's a good idea for young students to have at least a couple ideas of what they want to do as a career after high school. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
451E8369BB76,"Yes i think the students are benefit because they don't need come to schol just what they have to use is a cumputer. and i think is more better because you can do more thinks in you home you can help you family. and you have time to work and you can study in the same time. and they can make money because after you done with the high schhol if you want to continue in the university. and you have money you can continue. and if you come to school you have time to work. and if you study from you home you have time to study and so more think. Because a lot of people don't came to school because they need money to buy food and pay his rent because they don't take help from his family. For my example i came to school because my family help me but a lot of people from others country came to this country and they don't have family here so they wanna study but they wanna help his family and his county and if a lot of school have the program what you can take class from you home i think is more better because you can do a lot of thinks for example i know a lot of people they wanna study but they need to work so they say they can't study and work in the same time so they have to take one of two option so they have to pick one and they say they wanna work because if they go to school they can't make money and if they work they can buy his food and they can pay the rent for example i have one cousin he was in school and he need just one year to graduate but when he was in schhol his mom said he need to work because she don't wanna pay his rent anymore and he leave the school and he dedicated just to work because he need pay his rent and if school have the program he can work and he can study too that one is to sad because he ned just one more year to graduated and he don't graduated because he need pay his rent tha's want i think is a lot of school have the program they help a lot of guys

Here is one more example a lot of people live in mountains and the bus don't go so they don't have transportaion so they don't come to school that is sad because maybe they wanna study and they can't come. i know people in west virginia. they don. t go school because the school is like 1 hours and they don't have transportation. and if all the school in united state have the program they can help a lot of familys and they cxan open a lot of doors for the people.

Here is another example i have one friend. He come to school just one or two days per week. Because he need to work. Because he said he have to work because he don't have money for buy food and pay rent in the same time that is sad because he said i want to graduated but i can't because i havde to work for pay my rent and buy my thinks. and if schools have the program they can help him to do his gol.

I meet one friend in walmart last week i play for soccer team in Generic_City . and i was with my short that say barsity in the from of the short. and the guy said hey in think i know you and i said where you saw me. and he said in Generic_City and. He ask me if i'm in Generic_City now and i said yes and you and said i'm not in school anymore. and i said why and he said because inmigration took my parents and they send to my country and i'm alone in this country so i need to work for pay a lot of think. and he said i wanna study but i can't because i can't do two thinks in the same time. and said my gol is work with police and i said hey wanna you don't study in the day and work in the night and he said i can't because i have to help my parents in honduras because id i don't send money to then they can buy food.

my mom maybe love if i take class onlines because she work all day. if i take class online and can help her to do thinks in my home because she go to work in the morning at 7 am and she came back at 5 pm and the end she go to the part time and she come back at 11:45 pm and if i take class online i can wok too and i can help her with think in the home and money to pay a rent she is to old.

E508BAFC3BF9,"Yes I agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family.

Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too.

I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress.

First of all I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you.

Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

At that time you have this big opportynity to sturdy and learning online, before work and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to or you want to do in that day.

It's not noly online you take the class online but, you will have a viedo conferencing to motivate you, that if you not understand, that can explain it to you.

1928846BB272,"I believe that is good idea for the students to commit to a career at a young age. Instead, it is important for the students to find the specific career and graduate before time. In point of view, some students can choose, if they want to a specific career or more. In thesis statement, students can find the specific career because is great opportunity and good idea.

First reason, some students are considered to find the specific career. Because they want to enter to the college at their young age. For example, Generic_Name was prepare to enter to the college at her 17th years old and she win a scholarship, and enter to Generic_School to study her specific career. This shows that students can achieve their goals at their young age, that nothing is impossible.

Second reason, some students have to find the specific career. Because they want to prepare before graduate of high school. For example, Generic_Name had her classes pass and all the credits before 12th grade and she apply to the college to her specific career. Being students it's not easy to achieve this specific goal, but with work hard and perseverance all is possible.

Third reason, some students think that they can't commit to a career at a young age. Because they don't have courses to guide toward a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is in 12th grade and she wants to graduate before, but she don't pass her SOL and she have the enough credits for graduate. So this shows that students can't commit to a career. If they don't have everything that is necessarily to find the specific so they cannot achieve anything.

In conclusion, it is important for the students to find a specific career at a young age. However, it is a great idea to find the career that proponent to achieve before the time of graduate and get all that you need like: credits, grades,

exams, and courses. Also, this is a great opportunity if you want to be someone professional in this society. So be positive and perseverant.     ",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0
D3999CF53EFE,""" In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school.""

Some students want to take a career during they study but some students don't wanted to thinking about any career when they study in the school.

First, for example people want to know what do you want when you study if you think is more import ants to take a career when you study, and you are young most students know that is more important because you think about you future, and you want to try to progress you life maybe for give your parents a better life when they can to help you because they are older for work.

Secondly, we have many people in the world want to progress in his life because they think is more better for the future have a better life with your family, but is more important to know what do you know what career do you wants for progress your life because we have many career in the world that you progress better some students like to take a career more difficult like technology, teacher, technical and polices but any career progress your life.

However, students don't want to know what they want for his future because they thinking I was in the school I am young, and is the reason when they don't want to take a career during the students is study, but I think is important to think your future a career for helping your parents maybe your uncle, sister, brother, but we have many students they want to go to the school for have friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, and don't progress his life many people have problems about drug, drink, and fight.

In conclusion, I agree with this position to take a career before you graduate because is more easy to know want do you want to know what career you are interesting for progress your life is better know before that after because you have a career, and your mind have this position to take a career for better life maybe when you almost done you have what career you have for making money, and try to help your family in your life",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
F5EFA67354E6,"Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm.

I have good enthusiasm. For example I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasn't good at it or if I didn't like it because I don't want to keep repeating them just because I didn't try i have great confidence on every skill I have and i always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what i need improve on and I eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on i mostly got B's on the tests and quizzes it's way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done.

I have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didn't know what kind of video game to make i didn't have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didn't know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didn't give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily.

some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying there's no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didn't he just gave up and didn't even bother to try. However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they don't loose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still wont give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it.

3F80F96A6F5A,"Some people believe in praising a students to help them build self-esteems. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. On the other hand, other people believe that self-esteems comes from achievements. I think that self-esteems comes from both learning and achievements, but it mostly come by telling a students that there work is good for these three reasons. One reason is that people are giving good complement to student for their work that the student have done, sometime people would want to have the stuff the students would create, and last people would say nice thing to students so the other people wouldn't hurt their feeling.

The first reason is that people are complementing to student for their work that student have created. Some people would say nice things and walk away or they would stay and talk about what the student made and the meaning behind what the student created. I remember when I was a little kid, I built a toy car and my mom like it. So when i'm older, I want to create my own car and show my mom how good I am at building cars. My mom was the one who has help me boost my self-esteem. That is what teachers should do to student if they want to boost their self-esteem.

Another reason, is that sometime people would want to have the stuff that students would create. For example, say if you made a painting and someone on the street saw it. Then the person would want to buy it and you sold it to him. That would make you want to create even more painting and sell it. It would make the student think that the person like your painting that you created and that boost you into selling more painting. The more stuff you create. The more people would want to buy it. That is an another reason to help boost students self-esteems.

The last reason is that people would say nice thing so they won't hurt your feeling, But they do that because there jealous that they can't do the stuff that you can create. There are some people in the world that just give you hateful comment about your creation. And that doesn't mean that you can stop doing what you want to do. It doesn't matter because there are other people that are gonna like the thing that you create. There are people out there that maybe want to buy your stuff probably even a famous person would want to buy it.

In conclusion, people would try to believe in students so they could have self-esteem. But there also people out in the word that maybe don't like the stuff that you create. But there also people that do like the stuff that you create. That is why people are giving good complement to student for their work that the student have done, they sometime would want to have the stuff that students would create, and last people would say nice thing to students so the other people wouldn't hurt their feeling.",4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
F75D6E5CCE78,"Imagine how life would feel like when you can't have your favorite food at your favorite spot in school? would it even be fun to go to school or not. About a week or two ago i went to Panda Express to grab some food on my way home but at the time that I got there, I asked to get some white rice with some orange chicken but the workers told me they have changed their menu a little bit so i can't have some,at that point i fell so sad because that was the only spot that sold some in town. I think the change of the school menu would be a bad idea because,it will make students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way,it would also bring some money problems in school and it would also make some students keep on empty stomach during the school day till they get home to prepare some food.

secondly,If students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way andthey never came back, this would leave the parents worried because since the principal decided to change the menu they would have a reason for leaving school ground. Mr. principal i would be happy to tell you to leave the menu like how it is because it would make some students get in trouble and a lot of incidents will happen when they leave.0nce a bad incident happen out of the school ground,the principal would be responsible for all the damages caused when they left, keeping the old menu would be a good idea but we don't want our accidents and school detentions to increase.

In addition to this it would cause some money problems because if students are going to have to eat healthy then how would they gain more money easily to support the school when they are in needs of something. This is some of the way you can make more money so, Mr principal if you decide to change it the school is going to have to shut down at a point because when is no money to operate the school and pay the teachers and custodians they would have to leave their job and get a better one and once everyone one is gone there would be any teachers to teach the students. Mr principal because of this reason we should keep the old menu so that students and teachers can enjoy their selves in the school.

Therefore if the principal end up using the healthy menu this will led to some students getting sick because they will have to leave their stomach empty and they can't have what they want. This will cause a protest in the county because they supposed to eat what they like, and what the cafeteria think will be good for them to eat. In case of this of this reason the teachers will teach for no reason because the student are so focused on going home to eat what their mom or dad have prepared waiting for them,so if the principal wants them to focus in class then he is supposed to give them what they like.

In conclusion i think leaving the old menu would be a good idea because if the principal wants the students to try to improve in their class then he should leave it. Therefore if the students wants to add th healthy menu on it then he should let them vote on it whether they agree on what he is saying but i would say leaving the old one should be the best for the students.

4967076F4E7F,"I don't think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because when students coming home, they need to do the homework first. Maybe that's day some people have a lot of homework so they couldn't attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If they could open some video of online then I think some students can''t watching whole video. Because when I finish my homework, I feeling so tired and I just want go to my bedroom or play game, message, Facebook, ... I guess that's habit all students because almost students doesn't wanna be work too much and parent will be for son or daughter spend time for favorite like soccer, bamboo, ukulele, ... If the students might relaxing then I think they will learning better and faster.

Some parent want my son or daughter go to the bedroom early. Because parent can control them easy, example like some students will say I still do home work on the Laptop, but they playing game with friends. The best way is for students go to sleep early. If your might for students sleep early, It really good for eyes and healthy because one young people can sleeping enough eight our every night, you can feel comfortable for star learning better new day. And if you don't sleeping enough, you can't learning anything at school because you always sleeping in classes and teachers always say ''wake up, wake up''. It not good for you and teachers. And when you go home, time for sleep but you don't feel sleep because you sleeping in classes too much. That's why you don't feel want to sleep, and today to tomorrow to whole life, you still don't want to sleep early. Maybe that will be become the cycle in your bad life, If you don't wanna change your style.

I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is not good. Because when parents coming home, they need talking, do something or have a dinner with family. It's will be better you do a lot homework. If you have dinner every night, you will have a lot of conversation with your wife or daughter, Since you will be know what your family want and your sentiment with family will be better and better.

When students learning online or video at home, maybe they don't understand what video say and if they have a question, what teachers they will ask ? And if everybody have a question to asked teachers, the teachers can't responded the question too much for students. If students waiting for tomorrow go to school, maybe students will be forgot the question they want ask right now.

I think students need learning at school better learning at home. Because one people one idea, that's mean have a lot of answers your guess and you will be know the best the answers from teacher. It'll be helping you how to do work team. Work team so important with students because in your future, labor need you know how to work together.

63314DE11287,"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things.

Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day.

If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday.

Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage.

Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow.

The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

98CD7819C7EF,"Some people believes that making mistakes is how peoples move on to success. Othes believes that is if we are determinated person and having positives thoughts without limitations. Some others people realized right before they are committing the mistake and they are just avoiding them. Although some say, successing in life without failures, our lifes wouldn't make sense, because we would not learn how to be success in our life's. Actually, successing in life with failures is more baneficial to our life's, because we learn how to believes on us, and we may have a life without doubts.

As a result, if we are the kind of person who doesn't makes any mistakes and realizing to success. i think that we wouldn't know what are we doing wrong to be determinated person. Also most of the people wouldn't have knowlwdge to succes in their lifes. Actually, when people cling to themselves isn't good for their goals in lifes.

However, I believe that making failures is how we move on to succe ss in life and is more beneficial to our life's. Otherwise i can tell the 80% of the people belives that making failures is how we learn to success and we become a civilized person. Sometimes most of the people have goals to achieve in their life's. As a matter of fact,

when we are setting goals to our life's and we can't get that goal it's because we are doing something wrong and we don't even realize what's wrong with it. its when we are learning to be focus and making sure next time to be success and whatever we did wrong.

In fact, sometimes it's hard to when we have had failures a fewers times, because we do not want to commit mistakes, but i think that is a beneficial for most of the people. Because the most mistakes we have and at the same time we overcome to have more experience in life. First of all, when we fix what we did wrong. Also I believe that fixing problems is a good way to be success in life. second of all, my suggestions are that to be a positive person, and determinate, smart, and wise person it make us a better person in success.

In conclusion, some people believes that having failures is how we are success in life and others don't think that way. However i do believe so that to be a success person, we have to fail a fewers times, because it's really important to me to be a determinate person. I think that those are my thoughts to be a better person in successful. and by the way, I'm totally agree that we have to fail first to be a success person.",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.0,3.0

A5F6E232286C,"First of all technology has helped people in many ways to do various sort of things when people are in need of something. When technology was first introduced many people didnt know how it could be used to help save lives or help build buldings,schools,malls everything that we have today is because of how benefical technology is to us. The lack of human contact is not using technology too, much its by the person who chooses to use his or hers cellphone, computer and television while technology takes a important positive impact in peoples lives it also helps save peoples lives. For example in hospitals technology evolves every year so that when people come in very sick it helps them by detetecting what they have or whats going on with a accurate solution.

However people may say that technology has negative effects on people because it removes there social skills and the way people interact with each other because in older generations there was a lack of technology and people would communicate with others when they were in need of something. In contrast humans also have a choice to check out books,shop and play games without human contact. Many people still go out and shop in stores many also enjoy going to the libary to check out books even though we can't go to blockbuster and check out movies anymore we can always go watch one in a movie theater. Technology has come a long way from its past and it continues to progress and evolve every year we move up as we continue to progress the future might be filled with just technology.

The way i use technology are in many different ways i put a alarm to wake me up i also use my computer when im doing home work or projects that i need to finish its also useful when im stuck or dont know what something means so i use my phone and search it up online to find the meaning of a word or subject. In my opinion i think its very helpful and positive to my life it has helped me in many ways and it gets me through also in school activities i dont think it has impacted me to a negative side because going to go play soccer or doing something else has not stop me from socializing with others around me. In conclusion technology can be very helpful or in some ways bad for peoples lives i think that technology no matter what will just get better and help many other just like it has helped me.

I believe that is not the best choose a student's to practice this work to build self- esteem; for many reason, because some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree this is no the best way to improve in their self-esteem to practice on praising. And other is they need to improve in their achievement, because they are not sure if this come from praise or achievement. Also students they has the last world, if they need to practice the things the some people thinking to the benefit for their self-esteem.

1. Reason some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree, i think this is not the best way to improve in their self-esteem, because students they believe in praising but, this is not the option to learn in their self-esteem they need to focus in their achievements. even if some people belief on praising,they think this help students to believe in praising i think students believe in this source but is not the principal option to believe in praising they need to focus in their achievements, values and skills because is one the priority and purpose to believe in their self-esteem this ideas must be to help to lean focus.

Students need to improve in their achievements, because some people are not sure if this come from, praise or achievements. I think this are two different thinks, also one is believe in religion, for example: I belief in Jesus this is praise they don't need to compare, but i don't dismiss this idea,because is good idea to students believe in praising. Another is achievement this come from the goals you made and the effort you did it for your accomplishments.

Also students their has the last word, if they need to practice the things the some people thing, to the benefit for their self-esteem, but the two are good idea for instill students don't believe, if this is the correct option, also they need to make the best effort to practice the best way to help their career in the future.

In conclusion the students dont need to practice thing that some people thinks,to improve to help and learn more about self-esteem, this is one the purpose to improve their self-esteem, this is optional in what you believe if their praising or achievements but this two different things, but is good idea learn both for better self-esteem to understand.

Do not conform of what you already have try to be better, because if you do not try you would not get chance to do thing and you probability would not grow. In my opinion you should try new things and not be stock in what you already mastered because ,You can learn new things, You can grow as a individual and as a community and You can help others.

When you try new things we learn because the make us grow,

for example if you want to open a buisness of finances in your community but you do not know how because you never try to do it you ask someone that have already mastered of doing it and you can start doing your buisness because you already try and you learn how to do it. another example would be going to college and there is a class that you already know because you take it in high school and you explain the thing to your friend and you are a mastered doing it and one of you friends ask you for another class problem but you do not because you haven try the class but it sound interesting and you want to try it because you want to learn new thing and try not matter what your situation is in your life be confident of your self. other example would be try to cook and learn your self that can teach you that you can try by your self and learn by your self but you try and that what it matter you try.

Try new thing help you learn and learn help you grow as an individual and as a community for example you grow as an individual because you take the class that you friend ask you before and you did it answer him because you haven even try then you try and become a mastered doing it and you open a buisness the community start growing and you open more buisness you become more important and the community grow more as well as you and you became someone important for the community and you keep having chance to be better every time that you learn you start helping people that do not have a chance to imprube them self. an for teach your self of cooking is a motivation to other to try the same thing.

You can help people when you grow because you learn how to do the work and now you teach the work to other to they can have a better chance in life giving them a place to work and having them grow as well the community grow because the buisness that you open people was more interesting in your buisness and they make you offers and tell you to work with them but you are scared that you work may not work but you remember that if you do not try and stay of what you are mastered you would not grow. cooking your self help the community to have people to get in head and teach others.

Even if you do not have try something and you think you can do it and you fell, you would be more sad that you do not try before you do it or ask someone for help that ready do it is a big mistake, try before you do not grow ,you do not have to be conform of what you already have because you can help others and make your self be proud and cooking for other and tell then that you learn by your self is a inspiration to other do the some thing and the way that you grow as trying thing would make the community more interesting try to grow before you give up.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.5

For example, the students can practice deports that they like, the student can not feeling bored in classroom, and the students can take elective class, or academy. However, some students would do not like choose the offer distance learning as as an option for students to attend classes home by away of online or video conferencing. Just the student do not have other option to take credit for graduate.

First, the students can practice deports in the school because, the most students love practice deports and the school give then these opportunity . It is a passion to make what are you like. For example, when I feeling sad these the form how I can distract me, entertaining and I feeling good because, I can share with other people my passion for soccer. The practice deports can help most students to not consume drugs, or participate in gang. The young need a different world where they can have more opportunity to realize the dreams.

Second, the students can not feeling bored in classrooms. All students like to feeling motivate, happy, and entertaining. They do not like to be all day in one computer, or landlocked in home, so these the reason that the students like to going school because, they can share with their friends and know new people. For example, when I confused ,or need help with my homework I can ask my teacher, or my partner. we can travel to know the university, teather, and museo. We can learn about our history.

Finally, the students can choose elective classes, or academy. One of the reason that the students want to take elective class is because, they can to know what are their like. All schools in our country have elective classes, or academy about: kitchen, piano, cosmetology, art, fitnes, medical assistent, dentist, band, police, detective, electrician, and medical emergency . These class can teach us to find what are you want to study in your future. Only in school you have these great opportunity for know how you can to take a credit in a bank , or how you can they help for your university, how you can applicate for a beca and choose wich university do you want will going to study your career.

However, some students do not have the opportunity to going a school because, they do not have family, others have to work and they do not have time or car to going a night school, and do not have other option for graduated that accept the offer to attend classes from home by away of online or video conferencing.

If people fail and grow up without losing hope, they can be successful in their future. Although some people thought failure is not good for their life, nevertheless, some were thought failure plays an important role in their life, because, it makes them to learn more about themselevs and become successful in their life.

Failure can make people to learn more about their self. Because after failing, people can know themselves better than before. They can know about their strength and weakness. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. But she said she is not good at math. For that, she don't like to do math at home or do it by herself. She always copied from board in classroom. Because she never try to do it. Suddenly, one day in her math class, she was called by her teacher to solve a math in board. First she was saying that she doesn't know how to do it. Fortunately after looking at the question, she did it. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. Which makes her feel confident about math and herself. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. Unfortunately, she failed one of her test, which makes her feel bad. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. So she prepared herself for retake and she took the test second time and then she pass the test on second time with a good grade. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal.

Furthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. To become successful people have to have positive enthusiasm. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because when she was a junior, she didn't pass her English 11 SOL. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didn't gave up. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. Some people also cannot reach their goal in first time. But that doesn't mean, they never can be successful. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. If they fail, they can try their best for second time. And always there is a second option for every problem. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. And then they can become successful on thier life.

Overall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. People can successfully reach in their goal if they learn from failure. From failure people can learn more about themselves. And people have to have positive energy and hope to handle any situation. Because failure is an important role that plays in the pursuit of success.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

EBD586EB3AA8,"Schools should not have a four day school because, some students may not have time to stay more hours, some students have a part-time job and others help parents to taking care of younger siblings. However, some people have different points of view by, believing that extending schools days that benefits the energy, resources and even helping students to learnd more. An example, is just having four days work or school week. This adaptation can have good and bad benefits. Some people believe that, havig just four days of school is a bad idea because a student will not have time to work or do other activities. A reason of this is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parents taking care of their siblings.

One of a major idea is students will not have time to do their activities. Since school is going to end late. Students need to finish all school assignments. However, Elementary schools will end later that High schools or Middle schools. That will not letf them much longer for them to pass time with their family. Students will be more eshausted, that can be really worrying because their grades can go down. Parents will not be happy with their kids grades. This adaptation can be really helpfult for some people. However, it can affect some other people lifes.

Another reason is some students have a part-time job. They will no have time to work and even if, they have the time it's going to be difficult for them. An example, if students get out from school late they have to run to their house to get ready to go work because they may be late for work. However, going to work for them is not that easy some of them don't have their license yet. Some of them have to walk even take a public bus. Before considering the benefits of four days of school week there are a lot more disadvantages that can affect students with their normal life.

The last reason is teenagers helps parents with their siblings. Although that can change because if students have to stay more at school their schedules will be longer than a normal. An example, parents will have to find someone that can stay with their kids and that means that is going to be more cost. Parents will be unhappy paying more money to a babysitter. However, is reallly hard to find someone that can be dependable. Even if teenegers have the time to take care of their siblings, they will not have time to do their own stuff because they have to do two things at the same time.

In conclusion, these ten hours school not just affect students will affect the whole family because students will end really eshausted even, teachers will get tired too. After considering all the benefits and disadvantages there is a point about conserve energy and resources that does not make sense, if students get two more hours of school for four day that means that there is not any conserve anergy or resources because we still using the same five days hours in four days instead five days. Reasons why students should not have four day week is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parent taking care of their siblings.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
F9E1434B2151,"Throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. In the past,schools couldn't offer differing alternatives,because technology wasn't as present as it is today. Schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. By students taking classes at home,they'll be able to benefit because they won't feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wont't have to endure social issues, such as bullying. Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they won't have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,there's a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because he's always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldn't have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people don't tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,it's an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, who've unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasn't for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldn't have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldn't really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we could've ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning. ",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0

D401F5D87E45,"Dear Principal

The Police i think is correct is Policy 1. I think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey Policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so I think Policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch. I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, but if is in lunch or free time I don't see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school.

If we put policy number 2 at school it wouldn't make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time. So I think that school are a problem while using it in class but I think that is not bad to use it during lunch time or free time.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0

EAB3924FD98F,"Students should take four years of high school, instead of three years, because students can have more time to learn, students can have electives, students can enjoy their summer vacations and their evenings, and finally students have more time to do stuff.

Althought some schools think that is better to offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, actually students should take four years of high school. First students can have more time to learn. For example, in a year students can learn much stuff, and they have energy to learn, in the summer students just have two months to study, so they don't have much time to learn all the stuff they learn at school, in evenings students have three months to study, the classes start a 5pm and end at 7pm, so at that time students are tired and the don't have much energy, so it's difficult to concentrated and learn all the stuff. Second students can have electives, students can have classes like gym, art, and music students can discover new talents in that classes, also students relax their minds in that classes and enjoy the school. Third students can enjoy their summer vacations, students get tired for study ten months, is good that they can relax and pass time with their family and friends, so their mind is clear, and when they start study they have good attitude, energy and they want to learn new stuff. Finally students can have more time to do stuffs, because they can go home and do their homeworks, study for exams, pass time with their family, and have good sleep hours, they don't have to worry about go to school in evenings, they can relax.

Students should take four years of high school, so they have more time to learn, they can have electives and learn new things, they don't have to study on the summer and they can enjoy their vacation and evenings with family and friends, and finally they can have more time to do sttufs.

E65D5A2616D2,"Imagine an old proverb said honestly was the best policy. What would you if some one used honesty in a bad was would you disagree or agree? I would agree because some acts of honesty can really mean a lot to someone. An old proverb says honesty is the best policy because it is the key of telling the truth and it can also create new friend ships in life.

I would agree that honesty is the best policy, but if you miss treat honesty it can be very lethal to your trust with people. To lose someone's honesty is very hard I have seen car crash which someone got severely hurt and the person who crash into him won the court battle because he was not showing honesty. My father has told me honesty is a great part in peoples life. My father has told me stories were his friends have seen people get robed and their honesty has helped find who did it and convict the criminal. Even just a little bit of honesty can help anyone. But when you use honesty you should never use it in a way that might hurt someone's feelings. I once was playing a game and the opposing team was not being very honest which hurt some of the kids feeling's on my team. But a persons honesty can always change at all times. I once had a friend who was never honest but changed through out his life and started to realize why honest is so important. I even have made new friend ships in life just from being honest. As we can see you might be able to get something from being honest.

If you are always honest people respect you. I have been in instances ware honesty has created respect for me. When you show some form of honesty it creates a good environment around you which can make good relationship you. But when people use honesty to hurt your feelings by not being honest it makes you feel like you just have been hit by a train or it feels like you have been betrayed. Once I was walking down my street and saw that there was lots of police cars out side one my neighbors houses. I heard that she got robed a couple months ago and found a witness that saw who the thief was because the witness was honest with the police it helped find who did the crime. As I can see honesty is the best policy.

In conclusion, no matter the incident that happened you always should be honest. Even in the future your actions can be justified from your honesty. Honesty is the best policy because it impacts you to do the right thing and creates a good environment. When being honest it shows that you have a high self steam which is can be very good for you in the long run.                                ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

I think working in group it is fun becuase each person in the group would l help. That why I prefer working in group than alone because the desventage of working alone is I can not get help from anyone. Also I can not finish it early it would take long.

Second, for example If I work in group we would descuss first and then be an a agreement. Then start working each person in group would have to answer and with different answer. If any one in the group does not know the answer the group would help him or her. It is easy and fast to finish any class work if it is in group. Working in group it is fun because each person learn from another idea of the other person.

Third, working by yourself it is kinda hard. Some people prefer working by themself because they think it better. Working alone is more stressful. That why people should work in group. It help and it is more better and less use of their mind.

Fourth, for example if I do a classwork by myself and it is hard. It would take me more time to do the researchs in google. Also I would finish it late. That why I prefer working in group than alone.

fifth, finally I would like to recomend to each students to work in group unless they are smart enough to do it by themself. However some students or people like to wotk alone if they smart then probably they would finish it on time. Teacher should be agree with me.

E566F0D20F98,"I don't think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldn't have the chance to experience what it would be like in school.

If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online.

Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students for the real world because when you work you can't do it from home on a computer. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you can't at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you can't at home. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you are at home,wouldn't you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes it's a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also it's boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers.

I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can't keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. I personally don't think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it's like.

Therefor I don't think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. Student should attend school and experience it all not be home distracted and miss many chances to learn new things and socialize with peers. Maybe even discover what they are good and take that for their future.        ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

We can all work together to come up with new ideas so that our paper makes sence.

7203112033A1,"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
9DD22B9D10F4,"Technology is taking over the world! There is now less human contact. People may think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives, but that is false. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it impacts their health in a negative way and people get too dependent on technology.

Health is very important, but people take good health for granted; To begin with, technology may impact individuals health in a negative way. For example, people's vision might get blurry and people that are looking down at their electronic devices impacts their neck position. Furthermore, people may slouch down when they are using a computer. This is important because people need to be more aware of what can effect their health in a horrible way.

The use of technology is phenomenal, people use it in their every day lives. Therefore, individuals get too dependent on technology; For instance, Individuals use technology to communicate with others and they use it for location. In addition to that, people use technology to educate themselves. Although those are beneficial perks, it causes people to be too dependent on technology. This is important because instead of people completing tasks with technology, they can easily do it themselves. To illustrate, if people want a snack they can walk down to the store and buy it instead of ordering it online

People think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives since people with no available transportation can order online or if others live in a area that is dangerous, they can order online to receive the things that they want to be safe; However, technology has a negative impact since it makes people risk their health. In conclusion, the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it can possibly impact their health in a horrible way and people get too dependent on technology, but they use it to help themselves.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0

Examples are that if you are wasting your time doing things that are going to ruin your life you will always failure and you will loose your enthusiasm and if you don't think what you are doing one day you can do something that you will never wanted to do in your life and there is where going to be seriuos problems with the police and you will jail for a couple years.

So that's why you will need to be always positive with things that you wanted to do in your life never think that you will never going to make your dream because you can make it thare are people that love your family so you will never going to be alone some reasons are that if you make your dream that you always wanted to be and your family are working hard to help you they are going to be so proud of you them you will said thanks god for all you give me and you will be so appreciated with your family because without them will never do what you always wanted to be a good person you will have a good work and you will going to have that car that you always dream to have when you was a kid.

51CE1DCC5307,"Some people might have heard this before, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" This is what the great artist Michelangelo said. People might not agree with this, yet setting aims higher is better. This is because by setting our aim high, people will be able to achieve bigger goals. Setting aims high might conceive more unique thoughts than people with rivet thoughts that set their aims too low. There can be significant possibilities towards many directions too.

Firstly, by setting your aim high, there can be significant possibilities towards many directions. Many people set their aims before they do or think about something. For example, which do you think will have more possibilities for job. Just applying for cleaning dishes because that's easy, or applying for every work field you can work for. This is the same for schools. For an other example, a student that does not know what he wants to do for his future choosing to go to the military, or going to collage with many opportunities. Going to the collage can increase the job opportunities and he might find a better job than going to military.

Furthermore, setting our aim high will help people to conceive more unique or their real thoughts than people with rivet thoughts that set their aim too low. For example, people that aim low are most likely conceal or are not aware of their thoughts. This is because people that aim low will not try to achieve something too hard for them. On the other hand, people that aim high will try to achieve more harder tasks, and think about more things. This will help the human brains to develop and can help people to think in a unique way than other people. Famous artists that have created significant art works could have not created anything great if they have set a limit for their self. They all did not make any limit for their self and their abilities to create great works. All the unique ideas and arts exist because the famous artists aimed high.

In addition, by setting our aim high we can achieve bigger goals than setting a lower aim for a higher possibility. For example, Just working for the minimum requirement for an assignment than working for the maximum of that assignment, which will give you a better grade? The answer will most likely be working for the maximum of the assignment. If you have your aim low you might give up before you achieve a task even if that was an important task. If your aim is high you won't give up and achieve the task. Therefore, having your aim higher is better than just trying to do the easiest thing you can.

Some people might say that by setting the aim too high that can make them suffer. This can be true, but that does not mean you should aim too low. what is important is to keep everything balanced to the best. Everyone has been said to eat a balanced meal when they were a small child. This is the same for everything. Understanding your own abilities and setting the aim to what you can possibly achieve rather than setting the goal for something easy. Some might say that if people don't aim high they won't have to work hard, so they will have less stress. They might have less stress but not every stress is bad for people. Stress can even help people sometimes. For example, I was a student in Japan that hated school and was too lazy to do any work. I had a lot of stress and that made me stay at home all the time. Staying at home did not relieve my stress at all, and I did not feel good about my self. Therefore, I chose to go to school again. Stress will mostly affect bad for you, but there are good affects too.

Finally, The hole point about this is that running away and choosing the easy way is not the best decision. Aiming low might look like it's the simple and easy way thats safer but whats really the danger is for people to forget to aim high and believe they can achieve great things. The best is to make a decision that wont make you regret and making the best aim you can make. No one has to be excellent or perfect, but everyone should try their best in their short life so they can die with no regret.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

E20DE200FEA8,"There are people who believe that true self-esteem comes from praising the student's work and others believe that true self-esteem comes from achievement. There are situations where a student should feel that his real hard work is considered good by praising his work. There are some students that feel that their work was good, because of their achievements. There are some types of students:

Students that make themselves feel especial when their work is appreciated

Students that feel that their work was hard by achievements

Students that even if they do not try their best, want their work to be praised in order to learn

Students the feel themselves in a position to learn when they do not give their best effort and it is praised

There are many students that deserve their work to be praised to build self-esteem, because they have really tried their best in order to get their work done, but there are many students who do not deserve their work to be praised, especially if they have not tried their best on their work. Those students who try their best on their work, they deserve their work to be praised, so that they can notice that the real hard work that they have done is appreciated. It would make them keep their hard work.

There are some people that truly believe that true self-esteem comes from achievements. It makes a lot of sense, because achievements come from real hard work. If any student achieved what they wanted, it meas that they had worked hard for it. If people want to build true self-esteem through achievements it is a great idea that they have that on mind, because it would make them feel especial if they achieve it through hard work.

There are many circumstances where it depends on the type of people and situation where you want to build self-esteem. For instance, there are certain type of people that even if you praised their work will not keep it to build self-esteem. There are certain type of people that will. There are people that learn by achievements in order to build self-esteem.

In conclusion I think that true self-esteem comes from both, achievements and praising. There are people who build self-esteem trough the hard work that has been praised, but also achievements. There are many type of people that build self-esteem trough achievements, but also praising.                                   ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0

think is better to work in group because has a lot of benefits. One of the example is the group help to think better,

each other and fast. second the workes is help to earn more money for the company and for the workes.

The first reason the workes is help to find information and internet or and books when some one had a problem like some one in the group is sick the other ones substitute in a job, sometimes in a group has a lot inconvenient like someone disagreement but then can fix an any problem to solve because they are professional.

The second reason is to earn money and hours,

when the workes work great an a job the company is pay more better , in a group is more beneficial for the company and for workers an extra hours,

because they do more efficient job, and also workes can help to earn more business with other companies and other countries more practical to work in a group they can help each other.

In conclusion I think is more beneficial to work in a group for several reason one of then is more easy to think in group help each other when the work is difficulty.

8F78E9AF1D0E,"Do you challenge yourself often? In this society today do you think we challenge ourselves by making harder goals or easier goals? Michelangelo had stated a quote that proves how society is today and how we set goals we know we can achieve rather than set harder ones and give up when its not accomplished as quickly as you thought it would be. For instance, it can be the littlest things that you wouldnt realize such as, doing your bed in the morning is challenging but you know you can do it so you make your bed every morning.

Furthermore, Setting easier goals that you know you are capable of achieving gives you an opportunity to continue to create more and more goals as time goes by. When you accomplish something it makes you feel like you can do many more things leading to something bigger. For example, when you study for a test and you take the test the next day then later received an amazing score you challenge yourself to study every night before a test rather than take a risk and challenge yourself to study the same day as the test because you think you would remember it better.

We give ourselves goals we know we can achieve and play it safe rather than challenges because its easier. Such as, knowing your limits and knowing what youre capable of accomplishing. For example,

you would rather do something you already know instead of doing something you have no idea what to do in and no longer enjoy it therefore, you stick to what you know you would enjoy by knowing your limits.

Finally, Giving yourself a harder goal and not achieving it frustrates you and can cause you to give up on your goal. When you dont know how to do something it's frustrating and you just give up for example, In the movie frozen Elsa was forced to keep her powers a secret and to no longer use them but she tried using them and froze Anas heart because she was frustrated. Elsa tried to challenge her self and try to use her powers but since it was so difficult she got overwhelmed and started hurting people

In conclusion, People prefer to set easy goals that they are able to achieve because it inspires you to continue to do multiple goals instead of one challenging one that you know is to hard. People need to realize that its okay to have many goals instead of one big challenge goal that can make you lose interest in things ",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

I think seeking others opinion on a choice that you have to make is good,because people can help you make the right choice for your self,learn what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you,and learn new ways on making that choice

One way you can seek someone's opinion on a choice that you have to make,is by asking people what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you. by doing this you will known their opinion on making that choice. Most people don't ask others on what choice they should make,because they think that people would make fun of them on making a choice on a certain topic. For example when someone has to make a choice on if they would buy some toy against buying a video game. I too have been in that type of problem. Another example is making a choice between wanting to get something you like but there are more than one things you could get and your friend making fun of what you say you want to get. To sum up my first reason of why it is good to seek people's opinion on making a choice,because you then can use others opinion to make your choice.

Another reason of why you should seek others opinion to make a choice is to get help on making the correct choice. One way you can get help with deciding on a choice is by learn the steps of make a choice. One way I learned the steps of making a choice was from a book my mom had got me to read. The steps of making a choice are first think of all the choices you have,then checking which ones you like and they suit you,and finally making your choice!.One other way is to ask friends and family to help you decide on your choice. A example for asking your friends and family to help you make you choice is,One day you had went to the video game store and you see two video games you really want but you only have $70 to spend,so you ask your brother on which one you should get and he says the racing one,but you don't known if you should save more money so next time you get both or just buy one now.

Lastly,My final reason for why seeking others opinions to make a choice is right,because you can learn different ways of how you can make your choice. One way you can make your choices is by finding all the possible outcomes. Another way you can decide on what choice is by asking friends and family give you ideas on the different choices you have and which ones are the best for you. An example from my life I have is,one time I was going to the ice shop and me and my brother did not known what favor to get,so I said why don't we try the new favor,because we had not ate before,so I think my idea for what we should get was good,because I came up with a new choice that we never had thought of before.

In Conclusion,seeking people's opinions on making a choice is good. I think seeking others opinions on a choice you have to make is right,because you can learn what they would have done if they had to make the same choice,help you make the right decision,and learn new ways on making that choice.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

Our school should have a community center. The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. Its a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better.

Students think community center takes their time away. but they have to learn what our community needs. students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs! due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades!

Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us.

some student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it.

so principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!

I have two examples, my family want me to be another person that my self, and the second example is if you want to be yourself in this world you will never find a job; You have to be another person the they want you to be.

I start with my family; How i said my family they don't like when you try to be yourself, they want you to be what they said, like jobs for your future they want me to be something the I don't want to be like: Soldier, Fireman, Lawyer, and president; I want to be someone else the they don't like to much, they don't like when I think in my self just what they want, they think if you are someone else you will have a big accomplishment.

In the case of jobs if you try to be yourself, and not what the company want you will never find a job; The happen to me alot of times when I try to apply to a job, they want you to be another person with different expression like: happy, active, team work, and accurate; If you are opposite of the expression you will never find a job with the expression the you have, so you have to be like the company want you to be and they would give you the job, then you will have a big accomplishment from the company because you are someone else.

That's why I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people don't like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I don't think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who don't belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0

British look at for you wan to have something good or other thing is when you start but the first thing is when you failure because not always your won on your goals but if you want to mejories your own life, you need to focus on goals and them you will have your success on life.

First, not social communication. The people spend more time than the neccesary using technology, and they forgot about the circle of the persons around them. For example, when they're playing video games, they spend hours playing videos games that makes them forgot about the person next to them. Secondly, Vision ploblems. This is the biggest one, around a 60% of the students in the school use glasses becuase the time that they spend in their smart divices them eyes ball get burn, also is those days is the first thing that the parent put in from of their childrens.

Sports is enjoyable activity because athletes use sports as a excuses to get good grades, so they wont have to tell there friends that they are really smart. They do this because they dont want there friends to call them a nerd or what not. Sports can be a fun thing to some people, but others use that to show there smartness without getting laughed at. They can also, use sports to prove to there parents that they are worthy. Sports can be used in a fun way too. Such as, going out on the court or the field, just being yourself, and acting a fool.

Another joy able activity is band. Band can be a enjoyable activity by showing who you really are through music. Music is always a big part of somebody or something. The reason why is they can express them selfs through music. Some examples can be, when your trying to explain yourself to somebody, you can do that by using music. Such as, find a song that you think tells people of you the most and tell them if you want to get to know me listen to this song.

Reason number one is that students that had A's and B's in the past years like middle school and the beginning of high school maybe qualify for the three year insted of the four year of high shool, because they are so intelligen that they not need the four years of high school.

Reason number two is that if they graduate from high school they may like to apply for a community service for there college aplication.

Reason number three is that some student don't have the money to pay for college so they may need a year to save some money to pay for college, or some student may not like college so they are only going to finish high school, and they are going straight to work, and the more experience you learnd form a jod the better it is so is a good idea to begin at a younger age.

So i think that the program that school offer to studen for them to take the opportunity to graduate early from high school is a good idea beacuse it will help them alot in there life.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

The first step of a person toward sucsses is school, and it is the golden part of our life, and to make it more enjoyable and comfortable for a student, school and teachers let us do some educational and exciting drama role plays, do a funny science experiment, and let them play their favorite instrument.

Today, we got some talented actors,comedians, actresses and etc, but they were also students in a time and were sitting on the chairs that we are sitting now. They did their best, try hard, participate in role plays in school, and now we can see were are they now. We can also reach there, and a best way to reach there is to participate in role plays in school, and improve our self from now. However, participating in role play is really fun and enjoyable. Role playing make us improve our daring to stand on podium and represent our self, and improve our emotions. By doing role play we can make people happy, and making someone happy is the biggest joy.

The technology and science has developed a lot and experiments are done day by day, and no one wants to stop these experiments. So for that now we want students to learn how to do experiments, and to make them more attractive toward science, we give them some fun and safe experiments such as:making rainbow in air, mixing colors or maybe disappearing coin, which increases their attention and focus on science, and it is actually fun to do these, and our big reason to do this is they are the future.

Every student has got a hide talent in their self such as; some students can play music, may draw, or maybe athletic, but these talents are not hidden for always these talents will get appeared sometime. The most popular talent among students is music. Because music directly touch your heart, and make you focus on it. Music have a lots of types it could be happy, sad, angry and etc, and it make you feel like that. We hear music everywhere on TV, in music class,and etc. When we hear music we get our emotions out and make our mind light, and we enjoy that.

At last, I think school is a place of learning, if someone want to learn something he always enjoy everyclass and get something learn from it. We should always enjoy at school and learn something. Because school is our main resourse of learning.                                      ",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

4CFAF19AF547,"Technology has it ups and downs with some being useful to use humans and some being harmful and destructive. Has technology come to a point where we need to use it in our everyday life or has it become where we don't even need it because we're to lazy to do thing ourselves. I think that limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has had many negative effect on people's lives because it can cause depression or isolation, can cause some people to lose their touch of reality, and can harm your physical or mental health. Likewise, technology can cause many harmful things.

In other words, technology can cause depression or isolation can really be very bad situation especially if you have both. Depression can be caused by technology because many kids around the world get bullied through social media ,and some get very emotionally depressed. That's when kids want to isolate themselves and don't go to school. Many people around the world like playing video games, and some are very into it that they don't even know that they are isolating themselves from everyone around them. Most people around the world have a phone, a cellular device, and use it all day and don't even come out once. Technology can cause a big impact on people's life and causes them to have depression.

Consequently, technology can also make people lose their touch with reality. Some people can easily manipulate other through the internet. At a young age kid like to TV, YouTube video ,and things like that, and many kids if not all are very gullible. Many videos on YouTube can make kids believed something thats is not true or even brainwash them. Adults also can get brain washed through the Internet. Many conspiracy theories say that the government are trying to brainwash people with technological advancement machine and many to believe that it's not true. Some people even get brainwashed by playing so many video game at a young age, and believe what they do in a games is what they can in real life.

Additionally, as technology keeps on progressing it's just going to keep on getting worse for our physical and/or mental health. Eye doctors say that if your always on a device and it will effect your vision. Technology can mental change you as a person because some people want to be like someone on the internet and change the way they dress and even in some situations their personality. In some cases people have watch many videos of people doing very dangerous stunt. Some people actually try and attempt the same stunt they saw on the video and fail miserably and end up going to the hospital.

In the other hand, technology can come and be useful. It can also safe peoples lives in a situation where someones life is at risk. Technology can also come in handy for us to win wars. It's usefulness can make someones life way more efficient. Technology just overall makes like so much simple and easy. People don't even have to stress about thing as much as they used to anymore because of technology. Technological advancement can change the world as we know it. However, technology can malfunction anytime or anywhere. Technology advancement machine can be the cause of someones death. People might think that technology is going to make life easier, but it's only gong to get harder. If people just let technological advancement machine do everything for them their physical health is just going to plummet down because people are not getting the exercise they need. Also people need to understand technology is getting in the way of something beautiful, the Earth. Technology is causing pollution around the world and killing our home.

Overall, technology is causing all these horrific things to use and we don't even know it until we look around use. I personally think that limitation of human contact to the use of technology can have a negative outcome on people's lives because can cause people to lose they're touch with the outside world, can cause depression or isolation, and can a severe effect and people's physical or mental health. So, technology can be ignored but it will never go away.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5

My fist reason is if man haven't imagined light would Thomas Edison create the light bulb? Second, is because imagination gives hope. Hope for one day to cure cancer, hope to stop world hunger, hope to have world peace.

Phones,laptops, microwaves,how do you think we got their? Its because people imagined things other people thought wasn't possible. Because they didn't have the knowledge about it. Lets take the light bulb for example. People in those days used candles,and believe me as a kid whose been in the country side, it's not the same. Thomas Edison imagined if he can create light, and he did it. Now his work led to lots of good every day things. Like tv, microwave, electronic toothbrush, laptops and so on.

I had a friend,and her dad was sick. He had cancer and they couldn't afford the medicine. Her mom was a house wife,so she didn't have a job. If it was me in that scenario I would have gave up and accepted my dads fate. Unlike me my friend started working at McDonald. Getting paid 15 dollars an hour. She worked 4 hours on the week days and 6 hours on weekends. She made enough money to pay for her dads medicine and buy food for the house. Even tho she had to work, her grades where better than mine,and every time she felt down she starts imagining what she would do with her dad after after he gets better,and that gave her hope. Hope to work even harder.

2 month later it was time for her dads surgery,but she didn't have enough money for the surgery. Thats when the entire neighborhood decided to help her. After that her dad got his surgery and got better. Now she is in high school, working hard for for a scholarship.

If i am about to do something that i can get in a big trouble for should ask my parents or other adults for an advice.

I would ask different people for an advice, because i can understand something i could do better. Another good thing about asking for an advice is that if i go to like prison for murder, drugs or alcohol, in the future when i go look for a job nobody will want to hire me because of the stuff i did. If i am going to do something really bad in school i should think about consequences that will be and ask someone or more people if it is going to be worth of doing. When i am having trouble doing something or understanding something i should ask others a advice of whats a good way or doing it.

I think that other people should really ask for a advice. If someone wants to do something bad that they can get in trouble or they can ask for an advice.

3F20E4B1AA0D,"Should students have longers breaks during the school years? i have lestening to all the parents at school saying that students should get more longers breaks during the school year but i am totally desagree because, it is not a good idea having really longers breaks during the entire school year .Some students dont have the ability to learn easily than the others and if we get more longers breaks then we will not have time to teach those students who really needs help in school and it is not that the school is like trying to be mean to the students it is just that we think that if we give more education to the students then they will have a better future in their lifes.

First of all we all know that having breaks sounds reallly fun but sometimes we need to think about our future, in specific when we want to live a good life or have a better future and i think having breaks all the time it is not that necessary. For example, if someone is going to vacations, breaks and traveling around the world all the time, they probably dont know that is going on in the present or what are the news of the day , they are not being educate but in this case we are talking about the students so i think if students have really logers breaks all the time they are not going to be educate when they grow up , they are not going to do things by them self because they are not going to know how to do something .

second of all, giving breaks to the students all the time its is not good because, they are not going to have a good behavior in their future, some teachers works really hard to teach those students who dosen't have the ability to learn like others and when they going to vacations or breaks , all the hard work that the teachers were giving to the students will be gone because, they will not been focusing in school or they will not being focusing in what they were learning about. Also when students go to vacations or breaks they only think about having a great time with friends or family and i know that their are some others kids or students that sometimes are not like those students who dont really care about their future and i honestly think that if all the students could be educate individually will be a really good idea .

Finally, i think that the parents really need to know how important is to being educate when u are young because , when a person stars growing up everything in your mind change too. As adult i can say that it is hard to learn things when u get older. Sometimes when you get old, you star getting more lazy but when you are young it gets easy because , the only thing you have to do is study and focusing on school so that is why i think being educate is really important for a human and it is not good to be wasting time in longers breaks or vacations when we can waste all that time doing proyects, homework and activitides in school, and if the students have longers breaks then they will forget the knowledge during the breaks .

As a result , i think having longers breaks it not that really necessery for students specially when they are young because, a student dont really need that much time to relaxing or that much time to have a free time doing nothing . Also i can say that a student dont need a really a long break because, when i was in high school the only thing that i needed to be focusing on was in school becuse i wanted to have education, i wanted to have a better life and be a good person in the future. I also think that when you are educate you have more opportunity to get a job. For example , if you are not educate and you want to apply to get a job, the manager it is going to see that you are not educate enough to be working in the place ,so you absolully not going to have a chance to get a job. And i think that is really important for getting a job in whatever place you want to work in, so i really think that the students should not have longers breaks during the school year , that way students will be more polite in school and they will be focussing in learning more things that is going to take them to a better place ,to a better life and to a better future.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5
200671752EE0,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something? Yes we accomplish more if were always doing something but only if what we're doing benefits us. Why? Because if we're always doing something then we would succeed more in life, we would always be active and doing something productive. But it also depends on what kind of activities your doing and if what your doing is going to benefit you later on in the future. Because if what your doing isn't benefiting your future then there's no point of doing something that doesn't help you out for later on in life.

For example sports, if your always doing sports then that would be great way to benefit your future and also a good way to stay active. The reason I say this is because by playing sports you could have many different opportunities. Like getting scholarships into different universities, especially if you're great at playing the sport. And also it's another way to help you stay fit because your always doing some type of exercise in any kind of sport. So that brings me to my next example.

Another example is exercising, if you like exercising, going to the gym and just being active in general then that's another great thing to do that'll help you accomplish and benefit your future. Why I say this is because by being active it's going to help you to always stay fit and healthy. And how that benefits you in the future is because whenever you get older you won't have that many health problems or issues with your body so you'll always stay fit. What'll also help out a lot is by always eating healthy so that's something else you could do to help you accomplish and benefit your future.

Also working is something you could always do that'll help you accomplish more in life. Why I say this is because if your always working then that means you'll always have money. And having money would help you out in a lot of things. For example, it could help you out in school, for a car, food, clothes, and etc. Or you could also save up money for whenever you might need it for an emergency. It'll also benefit you by always having something to do so that way you won't just be home doing anything.

So in conclusion, doing something is always going to help us accomplish more in life. I don't believe inactivity serves a purpose because you won't accomplish anything if your not doing something that benefits you. You always have to be active and doing something productive if not you won't be successful in life. That is why I say that you have to do something that benefits you so you could succeed in the future. So yes, we accomplish more if we are always doing something.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5
3651697D855B,"FAILURE PLAYS IN THE PURSUIT OF SUCCESS.

I agree with the statement by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who said that "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". The word ""failure"" is been pictured as been a disapointment to family, friends or to oneself. Mostimes,everybody wants to succed in anything they do, but faces some challenges at the process to acheive that expected goal. This challenges are not necessarily proposed to affect you in a bad way, but sets a room for improvement and perfection.

Failure brings a feeling of confidence to a person, working on a project for a long time and fixing mistakes you came across. Makes an individual confident,understanding everything that concern that work and feeling more relaxed doing it without so much anxiety. Mr Rubio, was told to come up with an Architectural plan for a building close to a water fall. Rubio knew this project was close to impossible for him to complete this task, but he accepted it and started making the building plan. After he taught he came up with a suitable plan for the building, it got rejected by the state building commitee, because they asked him why certain things were placed this way and he couldn't answer effectively . He had to go back and identify he's faults in the building plan, and come up with a bettter one. Rubio had sleepless nights, communicating with various Architects and Civil enginers to get some idea on he's work. When Rubio was convinced he was ready to take the project to the board meeting he felt confident in himself and knew he could explain evrything corncernig he's building plan to the comitee. When he turned in the drawing, and was asked some certain questions he quickly answerd them with absolute confidence and got approved.

Secondly, the more you face challenges life throws at you makes you stronger. If everything in the world moved in a positive way we won't invent things inorder to satisfy our human needs. Isaac Newton and other scientst encounterd a problem and decided to solve this problems by making inventions. So work could be done faster, reduce Man power and done more effectively. Before isaac Newton got the light bulb to work , he failed ninety nine times of he's experiment. This failures didn't stop him from acheiving he's goal, he kept on striving hard making research and later came up with a long lasting light bulb. Which helps us see clearly in a dark place.

It's hard for many students to choose the career they want to study, some students leave school after high school, so they loses great opportunities that the school provides, but my dream is to have passion for a job, so I want this opportunity to make a good decision whether if I want to study marketing, through internships and shadowing opportunities that the school provide. I'm really interested in this oportunity because I want to learn more about marketing, which is the business of promoting sales of a product, as by advertising and packaging, also learn about inform new innovations and persuade the people; I'm really creative, I enjoy making posters, using social media, talking with people, and I can speak spanish, english, and a little of french, also I want to have organization and administration of the things, however, I'm interested in pursuing that type of employment, that the manager of a business can tell us his experience, to motivate us because if you want something you will never give up, I will always put all my effort to be a better person.

In conclusion, I hope I can have this opportunity, to make sure if marketing is the job I want for the rest of my life because it's really important to choose the correct job, the people need to have passion for the things that they do , so they can enjoy and be happy everyday, and I want to transmit that feeling for everyone.",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

89A2B91E59C5,"I know that having career coarses is a great idea for students to identify their careers in High-school. By studying coarses in High-school it will teach students the requirements for specific careers and prepare students for college and thier career if not required for college after High-school. Having career coarses will make students more confident and comfortable in thier first year in college or thier first day at work becasue students will already be knowledgeable about what thier doing, and it will also give students a headstart in life and which makes students well prepared.

Having career coarses will give a variety of choices for students and will help them figure out what they might want to study. These coarses will teach students requirements, basics, and will give them an idea of what they might want to study in college or a career after High-school. When students are getting ready to leave High-school some students still might not know what to study, but having career coarses would solve that solution easily which will cause less depression and stress.

There are four years in High-school which is enough time for students to switch out of a career coarse if thier aren't intrested. If High-schools don't take advantage of this idea students will be pure pressured to go to college and study a random coarse which isn't right if thier not intrested, that could lead them to drop out of college and waste thousands of dollars and could maybe go in debt for the rest of thier lives.

Career coarses In High-school will give students headstarts which is very beneficial for students and professors in college. College professors won't have to teach the basics, but will go over them which would save time and this also means students will have a couple of extra time for test's and final exams.

Having career coarses in High-school will cost a lot of money, but why not spend it if are main focus is to educate the students and help them suceed in the future. After religous beliefs school is the second most important thing in the world. These students are our future and we want the world to be a better place and have a better society.

We should reach out to the school board and colleges and let them know, By emailing, calling, or just by using social media that this is a very important matter and it would be very benefical for both them and us as students,

We want to suceed and be educated and having career coarses is the best way possible, we dont want to go in debt for the rest of our lives for something we didnt enjoy doing in college we want to be well prepared and every student should have equal opportunities in the world to know what to study.

Will be helpful for the learning of the kids because all the hours on school is good for the learning and you can learn more and more all days on school in this time, and when they put this one hour and half it will be good for all because also the family as the teacher like too see that person is learning something different that you teach them to do it.

When they put more time for the school the student can enjoy what they want and what they like example:Sports, Math, Science, Technology, English, Arts, Library or chess club that is the examples what the student can choose, they whatever he wants for their fun on that time and this good time will open the mind of the kids.

Sometimes the first impression can be good.

However if we do bad things like with our girlfriend if we treat bad her the parents are going to have a bad impression and that can change or with our friend if we don't help or if we give bad adviser to him the parents can think bad about us even if the first time we get a good impression.

Sometimes the first impression can be bad. For example in a job interview, during the interview if we don't use the correct language or if we go with bad aspect we can't get the job.

B942E0DA6A0F,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is best to be yourself than to be someone you're not. You won't have to meet some jobs perspectives. You won't have to be someone you're not. You can have many accomplishments throughout your life.

The first reason as to why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson is because, when it comes to jobs it can be real tough for some people. Some job's ask who you really are as a person, once you let them know they don't like the response. But, there are some job's that will accept you and will like who you are truly.

Second of all don't have to be someone you're not. You shouldn't have to please others only because they don't like who you are as an individual. Some might even say that its for the best when in reality it isn't. You shouldn't have to be the opposite of who you are just so you don't get judged on. Pay no attention to those who don't accept you for being nothing but yourself, and don't change for them unless you're doing it for you. You should always please yourself no matter what.

Lastly like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That writing is nothing but the absolute truth. Your individuality can bring you so much success. It can take you places you can't even imagine. Being yourself can benefit you as a person, people can perhaps like even love the real you. You can become a role model to those who are having trouble on deciding if they should be themselves or be what this world want's them to be. People could admire you and accept you even more.

In conclusion I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because it is best to be you own individual self than not, because you won't meet jobs perspectives, be someone you're not, and also it comes with amazing accomplishments. Some think otherwise because the believe that it would make life more simple and easy. Also you might find that being your own individual self gets you no where. ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
E3E6D43F34B2,"Should our school extend the school day two hours? No, I strongly disagree with extending two hours to school day. By extending two hours of school day, students for sure need to take a rest, take a shower, some students need to do chores, and also focus on their goals after school. If we extend two hours of school day, then students would not be able to focus on their education, because the brain cells need a break and need to refresh itself. Furthermore, if there is 4 days of school and 3 days of no school, then students will forget what they studied 3 days ago.

In Afghanistan, schools adopted a four-day school week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Therefore, we are comparing the grades and attendance of students. With extending two hours of school day, this system had effect students educational life. Students are not showing up to school and they skip school because of the new system. This idea had discrease the number of attendance and the grades of most of the students.

Finally, the regular school days and regular school hours are more beneficial then the new idea of extending two hours of school.

People now are smart and makes wise decisions on their daily basis. However, people tend to take risk upon their decisions without any consultancy with experts and authorities.

People should always seek guidance from experts and authorities whenever they are making any big decisions. It will be more easier for them to choose options when they seek guidance from someone who already knows about it. People often tend to make wrong decisions when they make decisions by themselves. A lot of celebrities have their personal guidance which is their manager. Manager makes a thoughtful decisions for celebrities to keep them on track of their career. If celebrities tend to make their own decisions many celebrities would go downfall in their career.

The decisions people make should be thoughtful and have guidance from experts. Christopher from into the wild book, he is one of the example for to take advise from experts or else people will end up like Chris. Christopher did not take any guidance from anyone while going into the wild of Alaska alone. He did not have any good materials to take with and didn't ask for help. MC candles died into the wild of Alaska because he was not prepared for the trip he was going into. This is exactly why people should take advise, if he would have taken any advice what so ever he would most likely have survived in the Alaska wilderness.

C79292B5F78A,"My thoughts on this are that it is good time and this should actually occur for many reasons first of all during the weekdays young people have school everyday only if it is a holiday or if sick. By implying this more young people will get out of the streets so late at night there is no need to be out so late at night in the first place. Second of all, at 10 p. m is a great time to be home during the weekdays it will keep you out of trouble and there will be less chances of young people dying to other criminals at night. Late at night is where most of all crimes occur and now the chances of this will be lower. Third of all , as their are so many people that sell drugs and if young people have to be home so early the chance of them getting into all types of drugs will be so much lower.

If this does become a law the times are also very appropriate Monday through Friday until 10 p. m and then Saturday through Sunday until 12 p. m no one needs to be on the streets later then this time that is being given. If they are their out so late there should be a extreme reason as to why they would be ""breaking the law"". This will most likely keep young people out of more troubles then they all ready are. This time is not unfair it is a very generous time to be home. This really should not be interfering with any ones life you can still go out but not be out for so late at night. I would understand if this law was also for people over the age of 18 because young adults like to party. But this law should actually be for people under the age of 18 that would make more sense and being a ""adult""(over the age of 18) they know what is right from wrong,what they should be doing, and what they should not be doing.

This law is not to harm anyone but it would to improve the community curfews to keep teenagers out of trouble I can very much agree with that. But those young teenagers are not doing the right thing then no matter what law that is added nothing will change the fact of how they act(keep them out of trouble). Going back to the time it is not like this law will be implying that the young people do not hang out with their friends this is just so more people can stay safe from all the trouble that is the streets. A lot of innocent people die every year by being so late at night and in the streets where some of the bad people come out. They have all after school to be doing after school activities this will not keep anyone from doing what they want. It is just a way to keep young people out of trouble there should be excuses to all of this like going to a party but there as well should be a limit to all of this. The consequence if they break the law should start of as a warning and then just be adding on to that.

My position on this curfew law is also that I would understand why people do not want this to happen but at the same time teenagers do know what they should be doing and what they should not be doing. I have two different view points why they should be worried and why they should not be worried. I know that people like to have sleep overs and would this be included or do they have to specifically in their house on can they be sleeping at someone else . Back into my other view if they go to a party lets say over the weekend where the curfew is at 12 p. m because it is on a Saturday and they come back at 1 p. m or later .They are not keeping track of time and lose the time. They are having fun with all of their friends and then they get caught because someone calls the police. Then the police comes and now they have to face the law and all that. Now what is next that being on their record just because they stayed out longer then they had and were on the streets. This would honestly suck and then going home and getting in trouble by your parent because of a mistake you made. After all this wanting to go to a very good college and they not accepting them just because they made a mistake for staying to late at the party. This would be a down side because if anyone breaks the law that will go on there record and not come out of there permit sadly this is a consequence that can happen and would suck. A college not accepting them because they "" broke the law"" not fun at all because colleges do look at everything anyone does before getting accepted and being a very good student with a high GPA and hearing this would not be good they will be carrying that guilt for their whole life by not getting into the college that they want to get into.

On the other note right now there is not a curfew to what time teenagers should be home yet but there is a curfew to when who ever has their permit for driving. So that is also a big restriction no young teenager is out in their car at a late time the only time you can actually see them is when they are getting out of school. There are pros and cons to this ""law"" but I think there are mostly pros then cons everything is very much reasonable and understanding. The only down/con that I can personally thin of right now is that they get caught and that going in their record does not sound good at all. But overall there are a lot of pros to this and this law should be seriously implied to all of the United States not only to one city but to all of them. This will keep more people safe yes pf course there is always that one person who wants to break the law as a joke or something that really should not be anything to play around with or anything but something that all young people listen to it take it serious.

In conclusion this law or curfew will stop all of these thieves from stealing young girls or boys and then selling them as well as to stop rape from happening so much because sometime it is very hard to detected people because of how dark it is. But this will most likely lower the chance of all these negative things to happen so frequently to anyone. It will also keep young people out of lots of trouble by being so late at night less danger.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0
1087B6C7FB98,"I say its a good idea that the school menu should change to being more healthier because a lot of students eat junkfood mostly everyday, need to eat more fruits and vegetables, and wanting a healthy live.

As you know, students eat junkfood food anywhere they go to such as movie theaters, gas stations, and restaurants. Some places do serve healthy foods and snacks but people rather choose junkfood because they're not use to eating good. Most stores put the unhealthy foods in the front, so kids can go straight into putting it in their carts or baskets. However, we can't manage telling people if they want to eat healthy or not.

Every school want kids to get a fruit or a vegetable at lunch. Some kids chose not to get a fruit or vegetable because they dont care about eating it or they it just throw away. Eating veggies will help you with your body like for an example; a carrot will help with your eyes. If kids dont want to get any of their fruits or veggies they could give it to a friend that will love to eat it instead of wasting it.

Eating healthy will not cause you to have much problems but, eating unhealthy will cause much problems. I think parents should focus on what their kids are eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you dont like eating unhealthy you could always pack lunch. Although, you could eat junkfood once or twice a week and not everyday.

I personality agree to having the school changing the school menu because the world has change and we want to eat more fruit and veggies, having our lives healthy, and wanting kids to stop eating junk food all the time. It has been an issue for the past years and I think its time for schools to have different types of food. Not everyone wants to eat healthy food we could sometime have some unhealthy at lunch.

I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because one it keep them out of trouble, two some of the activities keep them healthy, and three they are fun.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they keep most students out of trouble. For example, it can keep the students occupied so they don't have to be on the streets. Another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble.

Another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. For example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. They can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy.

Last but not least these activities are fun. There are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. For example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. There are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that.

Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. If schools which have this program available for students allow students like Generic_Name and Generic_Name to be part of it. The one who is going to be benefit more would be Generic_Name because he is the one who really need this program, he is the one who want to learn new stuff, he is the one who want be someone in the future. Generic_Name would be just one more of those students who are trying to take the easy way for everything, acting like if the world goes around him. But there is also an amount of students who can not have access to enternet or any electronic device to access to the online classes. So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself.

In conclusion some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, for students who does not have a hundred percent of their ability, student with health problems, students who really need it. Them also may create a program that help students without enough economy to take those classes. If schools are creating new ways or programs for those whom really need it, them most think about all the needs that them have and try to supply it, not with a hundred percent but helping with what they can. So students can learn and be successful n the future. Remembering that the one that are students right now, are the future of the world. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5
4EB117877F23,"I feel that we should work in groups because its more beneficial and others might have a better idea then you about something. Working alone might be boring for some people and if that person does know that they are doing the groupe could hekp them.

The first reason why I think wokring in groups is more beneficial is because more than on brain think better. More then one person can help on what they are working on. They can help each other on what they need help on. Four people in a group can get things down faster then only one person. People in groups have less to do then one person because in a group everyone does something and being by yourself mean you have to do everything on your own. You also get more tired if your wokring alone and in a group your talking to one other and discusing what you are going to do.

Another reason why I think wokring in gourps is more beneficial is becuase you can learn something new from another person and if your working alone you only have what you know. In a group you come up with more ideas and support them if you think they are right or wrong. If you work alone you get stressed out and if you work in a group you know what you have to do and thata the rest of your group is doing, but if they need help you can help them out on what they need.

My thrid reasaon why I think working in a group is better is becuase you can support other people ideas and oppinions on what they think is better on the work. They can have a better idea then you do and might work better on the job. If you wokr alone you only have your ideas that you think are good but if you work in a group someone could have a better idea or oppinion.

I feel that we should work in groups because its more beneficial and others might have a better idea then you about something.

77B932D27C9E,"It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three year and enter college or the work force one year early.

The students will have a all year they can use. If they graduate one year ealy it would help they in college or after college, it would be helpful for them in their future job too.

The students will be able to experience a early college, and they will be able to take their time to get everything they need for their life after college, it will also help some of them in the job they dicide to do, they will have time to get more experience for their job.

It will give them the time they need to get the diplomats or the dregrees they need for the careers the will chose after college. for the one who will be working after high school, it would give them the time they need to get to know their future jobs better.

Graduating in three year will help the students alot, it may take alot of effort, but its a gift and they will be the ones to get something out of it, that's why the students should be able to de everything they can to be successful in their ealy graduation programe. They will have to take courses during the summers and probably in the evening, some may not be able to take elective courses, but it will help them alot in their lifes.

I think that it's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early, because it will be very helpful for them in their lifes, it will give them the chance to eperience college or work force a year early, and they will have one more year to prepare their futrue.

Anyone in the world can be a smart and better person by working on a job to study about objects, study about computers like the use of technology and the learning of cybersecurity, and to visualize and gain your experiences on working in any job you want work on by putting effort and using your brain.

For example, you can imagine of becoming a scientist to learn about sceince, like chemicals, plants, experiments, and understanding more information about science and other objects by experiencing things. Like the more you imagine about things you experience through your job, the less knowledge you have to learn about something that haven't exist in the ability of inventing something creative that is very useful and better than anything.

All you have to do is believe in yourself and use your imagination like to decide whether invent something particular than the other like building a house, a long bridge, and create like a watch to study about anything and learn more about it, you can invent, create, study anythingby using your imagination by experiencing more about things you want to do when you grow up by using your brain, and knowledge to put more effort into jobs. You can also invent instruments, like an accordion, violin, guitar, and a piano, and you can imagine anything like cool stuff, like being an expert at teaching in school like a teacher, studying science,

being a doctor, a builder to invent or build stuff like buildings, or a manager who is in charge of training any team or an athlete for the next match, by having the ability to use your imagination.

the kind of clothes that you had been dreessed, the way that you speak and the face expression of that person.

As, peopple dreessed define their personality. If you have requiered to atttend to a meeting at work with the bosses of your boss, and dressed that is neccessity its not appropiated, they may judge on you and they could said that you are not a proffesional worker, or a formal person.

To get full attention people forgat a good value adecuated at the time of wave, meet, and speak with the other person. One reason is the major or important for people, and is the way the people communicated with others always matter because represent they selfs.

The expresssion with the face when someone meet others for the first time is never forget like when they heard your name, even the smile of the person most of the case represent the character of a person.

At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others.

F7B478DB88ED,"We are living in a world full of possibilities in the day to day basis, where we could decide wether to go to Paris the next day or stay at home sleeping in bed. The question is what would be a better decision in this set of crossroads. What would make the most out of our short lives we have of living. Perhaps you'll be surprised of how much yoou can accomplish in this lifespan. Being active on a day to day basis has proven to create more happiness and more ""success"" throughout people's lifes.

I think the many witnesses we have of people who have lived a ""succesful"" life is enough of an example. We have heard stories of so many different people who have stood out on their field; celebrities, journalists, corporation leaders, etecetera. What do all of these people have in common? They never backed down from their dreams and took every step in their life in action towards that dream. People like Steve Jobs could've stayed in the comfort of their homes, idle, to the outside world and the possibilities that they had to create something that would transcendentaly change the world. But they decided otherwise, because of their denial to idealness they shaped and transformed the 21st century world as we know it. All the people who we remember and our taught about in our history classes, decided to live their lifes taking action to make a change.

But many times we don't have a goal to find the motivation to take action towards our life. It should be reminded that the actions we take don't have to be for our own desires. Instead taking action and denying to be ideal allows us the possibility of one of the greatest sources of happiness: service to others. We are constantly battered by a world that seems more disastrious everyday, everytime we watch the news we seem to be living in world full of lies and grief. Where innocent people suffer the consequences of actions that are not their own. By denying to idleness and reflecting about the world we live in, we allow ourselves to create an impact on other people's lives. Spreading joy and happiness and making a mark on their lives. While also creating happiness and fulfillment in our own lives.

Perhaps a more gruesome but at the same time important way to analyze the denial to idleness is asking ourselves these questions: ""When I leave this earth, what do I want to leave behind?"""" What do I want my legacy to be?"". Hopefully your answer isn't nothing. Because wether we believe it ourselves or not we all have the capacity, capability, and opportunity to leave a legacy that we are proud of. We are all the determinants of our legacy. Wether it be something of large scale involving the whole world or something related to your best friend. We are all most likely to want for people to remember us. Perhaps it's something chemical in our brains that makes us want this or perhaps we want to know that the time we spent on Earth was of some value. Perhaps in our last hours of living we want the reassurance of this very thing. And the only way to know that we will feel that satisfaction is by taking action today, no matter where you are or what you're doing. After all when people were asked in their last hours of living what do they regret doing, they said that they do not regret doing anything, that insted they regretted not doing the things they could've done. Taking action is the way to leave footprints on this earth, by taking steps forwards, backwards, to the right and left. And perhaps more than one of those steps will be facing the wrong direction but it's important to remind ourselves that we have to keep walking because that's the only way we will realize how much we can accomplish.

Taking action in your everyday lfe and the denial of idleness allows you the possibility to create the world you once thought you could only imagine. By stepping out and seeing what life has to offer wether that be a flower or a river, it is what allows us to accomplish our goals. And the denial of idleness helps you realize that there's people out there who want your joy put out on this world. So my last question to you is: When you wake up tomorrow, will you take a step forward?",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
FF66DA76E15F,"Even though imagination is more important than knowledge, thinking in a creative way is better than learning something from somewhere. Yes, imagination is more important than knowledge because it's letting your brain think more about the things that make you happy the most. Also imagination is like thinking outside of the box (to me), but I try using imagination a little more than knowledge. Although knowledge is not as good, but some people prefer knowledge instead of imagination. Imagination helps me become more creative and open to myself because I let myself imagine, then let my mind speak free and be creative.

Becoming more creative and open is really good, knowledge does not give me the opportunities to do so. Knowledge does not let me be as more creative as when I'm imagining, therefore I have to start imagining. I think that imagination is a better way of saying art, because I'm thinking of things that may not even exist in this world. In that case, imagining is creative, artistic, and beyond, so that is why imagining something is better than knowledge to me. Imagination makes me passionate about what I want to do and accomplish it.

I've always dreamed of opening my own interior design company. That designs furniture,planing notebooks for office workers, etc, that are for houses, offices, and dorm rooms. All of that was because of imagination, I wanted to accomplish that when I graduate from college. Imagination doesn't just help me with what I want to accomplish it also helps me decide what I want to be when I grow up. Otherwise imagination would've not gotten us to where we are right now.

Finally, Imagination is something that brings people together like art and creative things. It also brings us joy and things that we don't really imaging on our daily bases. Although, knowledge is not important than imagination I still think that Knowledge can be used in someway and help me with something. Therefore I thing that imagination is more important than knowledge because it help me with my daily bases work at school, home, sports and all kinds of other things that I do.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0

I agree that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because of students needing more time on homework and studying, students wanting more time on other hobby's, and students would like to choose the right activities for them.

Students would like to have there own time to finish homework and studying. Some students would like to be involved in extracurricular activities which makes some of them having a hard time in school or having good grades, because they don't have the time for studying and completing homework, and also it makes them stressful because they might be having hard time to understand the teacher in the classroom.

Students would like to have more time on other hobby's that they enjoy to having. Having extracurricular activities after school or before school will be affecting the student in some ways like students won't be having much time to hang out with friends or playing video games, and also it would make the students really tired for school or free time.

students choosing what activity they want will be easy for them. Students would probably choose the activities that there good at or if they want to try it, and it helps them trying out new activity because it will be health benefit for them and they get to meet new people.

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I don't really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know.

9E8984D81AC3,"The only talent or skill I have would be doing tricks. I also think that mostly everybody can do it so in my opinion that is not a talent. I have other talents which are that I am good at sports like basketball ,softball,, track, and soccer. I been doing it seen's I was little my dad wanted my siblings to be out of the house instead of being on our phones so we had to learn to do sports.

The first one I learned is soccer because it's just kicking a ball and running . The cool part about soccer is doing the tricks and everything. Soccer isn't big as well know as it should be. In the middle east it's big but not like basketball or football the whole world loves those sports. Also in the England they call it football instead of soccer but I get it makes a perfect name for it because you just kick it with your foot.

The second one I learned was track it wasn't that hard because you run or jump. When running in the track it is not about winning because the wind is in your face and running and your mind goes blank it feels so good when you are stressed. The long jump is my favorite because when I jump it's like flying then I touch the ground and it is gone. That why running is my favorite it's not about beating the other person.

The other one I learned is I think it was basketball. basketball because it is a mystery if you make it or not you just shoot and hope you make it .Seeing basketball players on TV I think help me to be better just like them. The thing about is that the boys ad girls are separated because they think the boys are too rough for them the girls can be rough too but thats why they made the WNBA [woman national basketball assonstion]. In my school they have one for girls and one for boys but a lot of people come watch he boys one way more than the girls.

The next one is softball this one I just wanted to do something different when the other seasons are over. It was boring at first when you learn how to play it becomes a game not a sport. In school we have softball but we don't have baseball for boys but I wish we did I think is unfair that the girls have one but they don't. I wish we play it at gym but we don't all we do is play field hockey. Softball is also good arm excise if you play it all the time. Thats why of all the sport my favorite is track.

Our 3rd President of the U.S.A wrote a quote that say ""Determine never to be idle .....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Many people didn't believe in him. For a way that people would like to accomplish something is setting a goal, try hard, and showing them.

However, many people believed that setting a goal is a accomplishment. When some people set a goal they usually set an easy goal, so they can accomplish. For example, My sister when she set a goal she usually it so simple that she can accomplish it. But for some people they set their own goal really hard and they can't even accomplish it. After all for those who doesn't like setting a goal would likely accomplish something.

For many people that are accomplishing something they always try really hard. When some people accomplish something they would usually try their best to accomplishg something. For example, my brother accomlish something for trying his best at his final. But many people would not even try their best to accomplish some thing.

Therefor, many people could show what they accomplish. For those who show what they accomplish is that they usually do anything to accomplish sommething. For,exmple, Luke show to everyone what he accomplish for getting his mile run decreasing. But for some people think that is called show off. But what he did is that he accomplish something great.

First imression are big key to finding new jobs because it shows the manager how you'll act on the job and it will tell him/her if your worthy enough for the job, sometimes first impreesion are the reason you might even get the job like my brother exprienced with his job he went to the interview with a positive atitude and went in with the mentality of getting the job, I really strognly agree with first impreesions because people really will base you on first impressions.

E34E1B7D1691,"""I want to be a singer!"", is what I told everyone, at 8 years old, I wanted to become someday. As I kept getting older, I started exploring more career opportunities that I could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. With high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, It is tough to choose between the one I want the most. I wouldn't want to risk any of my hard work into a career that I would end up disliking. With that being said it would be a huge honor if I you could give me the opportunity to visit and get to know about the work that interest me.

While many students at my age have already decided what career they want, I am not sure enough to make a decision yet. However, I know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career I may be interested in. This program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success.

In fact, even by talking to someone with the career I am interested in would help my knowledge. Also, it would help me narrow down between which career I would most likely succeed in.

The dedication there would have to be behind getting to where I belong to with your help, wouldn't be a problem at all. With the skills I have already learned with being in high school, I would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. Your help wouldn't go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. On the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream I once had. I am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. Most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them.

A way of having a good attitude is by seeing things n the bright side of things, even though it's bad. Another reason why having a good attitude is important, is because people appreciate when someone gives them a good feeling either their sad or mad. Another reason why its important to have a good attitude is becasue you get things done properly, for an example, when you have to do a project due in two days you take your time and don't rush, you do things with a good attitude. If not your project will be at the end a mess, and you're going to be frusterated.

Having a good atitude is impotant because, you can help other when they're going trough tough times, for an example, whn my mom was sick and she was dealing with asma, we had to take her to the ER mant times. It was sad for me to see her all sick, not only that but she was pregnat and could'nrt anything because she had acid reflux. So whenever she felt sad and stressed out, I knew I had to support her and have a good attitude. By having a good attitude I had to help her with some house hold things because she could'nt really do anything.

Another reason of having a good attitude is by also having a good mindset, because when you have a good minset you can go through your tough times easly. And when you are stresse out abput something you have to have a good minset and a good attitude. For an example when I had to deal with by spine problembecause my disk was moved,I had to hae a good attitude because if I am ther complaining about my pain, it's not going to help me. So if I just relax and take rest and tak my medications then I will have a good attitude, because I know that everything will be okay.

So this is why having a good attitude is very helpful, because you can help others when they are going through tough times, or whenever you and I are going through tough times, and how it helps you succed in things.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

At a young age,students thought is more brisk. student will thing about the career that they will do in the future. At that time people have a illusion,visualize a bright future, have a expect on the career in the future. At this time, if the teacher gave student guide to selected towards a specific carreer. students will fiem and unshakable their thought. they will do the best one can to achieve the goals. Student will bring pressure on thierself. if do not have pressure,then do not have improve. In the high school, should provide the courses of select to guide them towards a specific career. For the reason: first ,by do this can develop good habits on the student, in the school. Second, student not only can study hard but also can get skills. Third students will be good at their class that they choose to be a career. In the school,develop the courses of specific career has more advantage. For example,student graduate on the university, they are not face with on the obtain employment. I think it is a good idea for student to gain the skill for the career.

On the another way, develop the career courses early, it will give student more pressure, because in this time student are still immature. if gave they more pressure,can not make students students but can make students fell repugnant. This way just run counter to student's intentions. Not all students need pressure to improve thierself. But some students do not need pressure. They do not engage in honest work and have neither learning nor skill in the school. sometimes students are not sure that they work on something in the future. This career class may gave this student more pressure,they should choose a career that they want to be in the future. Therefore,this ways just make students fell disturbed.

In short,the courses of study in high school are selected to guide to a specific career it is a good idea for students to commit to a career. Career is important. students should plan it early.

Students may have electives classes and decide what to do and what they like for be more good in the school and have some attention on it.

Firstly they will like to go the school because they will feel like a little break of a hour on the class that they like for be chilling. They will not get frustrated or bored on the day of school and they will get off of stress for all of the day they will have s time just for do what they like to do .They will forget all of they work that have to be done because with other classes have homework, class work and the students will be feeling tired. And may be they will not want to come the school anymore.

Secondly students will be doing something that they enjoy because they will be happy to do something that entertained their minds and maybe they will be creative with a lot of things they will want to do in the class. It could be exited for them to have a class that they would like to have. Is good for their brains because the brain is going to work with more interested for be doing something that get all of their attention and they will be relaxing because they don't have to worry if they don't know how to do something because they like it and it will be that more easy to make.

Finally it could be an opportunity for them because students can fine their profession, what they want to be in the future. They may decided if they really like to be for example a an Artist or something else. They may be fine that they are more good they think they are. And maybe they do a big and good work and someone like it for example a professor and they will recommend to universities and thats how they can open new doors for the future of this new generation that it could be the best if will let them have electives classes .

First, the schools don't need the follow that model and also to extending the school day two hours. If all the schools are agree about to extending two hours more, then they are braking the rule to converse more energy and resources. It is a lot of things that schools can use and the principal thing that school are using is energy. In the school office all the teachears are working all the time making copies, works and they are doing a lot of files.

Second, it's not necessary to extending two hours more in the schools, students can do campaigns to how reduce the energy or making groups of people and try to do things that help to conserve more energy. In this case we can created proyects that help better to try to not spend a lot of energy in fact to try to conserved. And then conserve some of energy.

Third, some of the students can created devises for extract the solar energy and used. Teachers can help to support to the students creating more ideas or proyects. Maybe is not going to change as how much energy we are using, but it is some that helps to reduce the energy, the point is to try to conserve the energy that we are using.

At this point to conserve energy and resources schools can follow that model, extending tha school day two hours. They have a lot of time to make more proyects maybe better ideas to how conserve the energy.

8FFDA5B9D359,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. That's really hard for a student to do. Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student.

My second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. They can focus better and get work done and won't be distracted by anyone there's a lot of benefits with that. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesn't need.

My third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Some students get distracted easily and can't in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work.

Another reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. It's good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something that's very important for students.

My conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them that's why I agree with this statement.

9F9C42BD3B7A,"We live in a world where each and everyone of us, will always need someone or others to rely on. In this world not everyone is born complete. However being yourself is always good, but you can also change yourself if you feel the need to. But if someone else were to change you then that would be very bad, because they could be either delusional or emotionally negative of certain things in life. When your being yourself on my opinion it means you shouldnt have others change the way you are but its up to how you feel about yourself.

I strongly disagree Emerson's statement on how individuality is a good thing, and i have various reasons or examples on this statement. I have many important people like my mom,dad,sister, and very close friends who are also like family to me. Having other people is vital because you get through life more easily, and able to change yourself as you live on. But if you got rid of all of that then you would probably live a lonely life in deep and total solitude. Having other people isnt trivial, you have to have faith in one another to get through life.

There was this one time where i was about twelve to fourteen years old, i would always struggle with my grades in the beginning of the school year, and have a strong sense of unease everyday i go to school because i always felt like wouldnt be able to provoke my self to do better in school and get better at socializing. I was only caring for myself most of the time, and when i get back home i would feel depressed and repugnant. But that all changed later when i realized i needed to have others to help me. As time went on i was able to change myself by others around me. The world isnt changing you you are changing yourself by just living a life with others around you, and you wouldnt notice that you changed either, but that is a good thing because now you know that if your able to change then anyone should be able to.

The last thing that is bad when you dont have anyone else with you, is that it can be really boring and not fun at all. When your all alone in your life, you wont have anyone to socialize with you, and keep you company. But when you have a lot of friends and get to know other people, you can have an experience with them and its what makes life really entertaining. When your with your friends you get to have lots of fun, like play games together, socialize, travel together, and get to have more and more experiences with each other and maybe learn more lessons in life. Theres a lot of people who think that we live in a society where no one cares about you and doesnt want to help you at all. but thats not true because it isnt there fault, because when you have others with you, it can have an effect positively and negatively. And people who are negative all the time can provoke others to be a bad person, which is why they end up all lonely because they fear of others or hate others because they think no one cares about them. But thats not true because all it takes is to change yourself, by having others in your life, or asking for help.

In conclusion individuality can be pretty awful and lead others to a path that is bad. Having others in your life is necessary because we can lift each other up, no one is worthless. Leaving someone on there own can be pretty sad, helping them is what makes you a better person and gives you a better and easy life. But as i said dont let anyone change who you are, being yourself is good but being alone simultaneously can be a bad thing. You are the protagonist of your own life, your life is your own.",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

It accomplish when we are doing something we maintain our brain busy and we make many things on the day instead of been doing nothing its helps us to develop and create different ability thats the reason why the teenagers after they work,for been busy the mayority of the teenagers get bored when the are at home doing nothing.

When people is doing nothing just been inantive they waste their time it doesnt helps them for any purpose doesnt give any beneficts to the brain. The teenagers in this epoch they should maintain busy and dont waste the time after school they may practice any sport or any instrument.

For me to do accomplish more is better than don't do inactivity. I have 3 reason why I think do more accomplish. First reason is, to be better. Second reason is, do more. Third reason is, feelings. There are some reason why I think that be accomplish is better. For some of the people be accomplish is hard to the people because they don't have to much time.

First reason is, be better is because your learn more, you have more experience. We don't wait our time if we do more job if we have to do more job we doing it. We don't have to be to lazy for do more job if we can do the job. Just if we don't have to much time that will be just to done the work. To do accomplish to spend more time doing it. Whatever thing is if we have time we doing it. I work every day if I have to do more work I do it but if I don't have a time do to my work I just done whatever I am doing.

Second reason is do more. do more can be extra work done that will be nice ti have extra work done for the next day if we do the same we don't have to do more. Extra work have to be complete by the time and then dependently what do you do about. When people do extra work in their job the make more money and also they make more overtime hours in their job but no all the job are the same. For me to do more work is more easy for one think I learn more for, another think I just do extra job because I have time and I like too. To more is when we the people have time

Third reason is feelings, why feelings? feelings is because when we do more work that have to be we are satisfy. In other way we feel like when you make a goal when you done. We have emotional feeling when we done the thing what we doing it and also when we accomplish more. After you finish doing the work we feel tired but is not the same when we are satisfy for done. when I do my extra work always measure that is good. When I know is good

I say ""yes I finishing"" and I feel so proud of me. when we do something we have to be positive for every will be okay.

In conclusion, to do accomplish will be the best idea for to better extra work. The reason why the accomplish is the idea is, to be better, to do more, and the last one is feeling. what Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we always doing""

45291197F292,"I agree

I think it's a good idea for the students to start a specific career young,because you can be getting early experience to working in a certain field that their future career my require.

Its good to choose a career now instead of later because reaching early adulthood with no planned career in mind, because you may have a certain job that you may not like since you didnt plan ahead for your dream career and you be stuck with a 9-5 job.

With things like finishing high school and not going into college to further your education for that dream job you want will make your chances of getting the job you want scarce or even impossible.

2. What makes It worse Is, not having the diploma required for that certain job which means you could end up in community college again re-taking class for your job you didnt decide to choose while in high school.

3.

And another thing I've seen Is having one career not work out and a person ends up not having a backup plan for their second career. adding to that some of these careers require years of school some specific schools like law school or going to a school for doctors.

I don't agree with choosing a career early in high school,

because most high school students don't know what they want to be or they don't have a career in mind at the moment.

Students should not be required to take a career path so early, when they have yet to experience their first job or paycheck. and not having any interest in the job offers that are shown to them on the application.

Most students are young, and requiring them to have a career plan will end up having them feel like they will be rushed, into doing things like going to career interest fairs choosing what he's interested in and why and talking about with others and what things he or she will need to do.

2. Some high schools care about future jobs they want while most don't so most will not care about their future career and just choose a random career to get started on because they dont know what they like.

3. Some high school students genuinely do not care about school or their own career, so they just drop out mainly because they don't like high school and want to do other ""things"" outside of school adding to that there could be a stress level that is being put on high school kids thinking about the future instead of enjoying the present.

My mom always told me,""do not give up till you are in the top"",after all the struggles you will be a better person.

Nobody can change yourself, you are the only one who can dicide what you really want to be in life. You make your own rules, but you have to respect others, I will give you a counsel, If people treat you worthless do not treat them like the way they treats you,be original and treat them like royalty, after that, they will see that who lose gold was them,not you. Do not let no one hurt you because we are in a world where no one wants to see any body get victory. All I can say is be yourself, if you want to dye your hair blue and you are afraid what people opinions are, just do it, do not start walk around to find your happiness because your happiness are inside. I hate it when people said like what happen if I do not looks pretty, you are pretty inside and outside, do not make yourself miserable.

The struggles will make you strong and get all you want in life, like David and Goliath, ""the little boy who fight with the giant warrior and he won, when he throw the rock into his eyes"", no matter how big is the problem and how small you are, you have to fight with your fear. If you pray to God and tell him what is going on in your life, he will helps you to solve it, like he solve David's battle. Do not let people change the way you are, because some people just come and goes through and we have to enjoy what we got while we have it and do all the things that we haven't, and thanks God because we are here.

Conclusion,

Live the life you love and love the life you live, just do what makes you happy. Remember that your happiness are inside, all you have to do is look for it and find something that you can prove yourself , that you made it without help and make yourself feel proud and do not let people take advantage of your insecurity because you are great, you are strong and that is all you have to do, focused on your success.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

32E2949B0C66,"Do you ever want to do something fun at your school that you really like? Well you came to the right school, cause the principal made a rule that you either have to play a sport or join a club that you like.

You could play on a basketball team

You could play on a football team

You could play on a flag football team

You could play on a baseball team

You could play on a softball team

You could play for a soccer team you could join a cheering team

I agree with the principal because, when we get home we don't do anything and kids are lazy nowadays. We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. Also it will give kids a chance to have fun and make new friends and see what they like so they can do it the future.

So if you don't agree with me, I'll give more reasons like kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape. Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube. So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friends while they're after school or join something their friends are in. Also it will be good if your going to play in high school sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team.

It is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on. Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win. If you don't believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did.

If your not interested in sports you could do other afters school activities like

Book club

Yearbook club

Dance club

Cooking club

Computer club

Student council

Engineering club

You could do those clubs in stead of playing sports, You could also do many other things that you like if you don't like any of this thing. Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office. If you don't like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet. Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home.

But if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club.

If you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, but if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school. Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing. Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal. But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit the teacher you will get expelled.

If your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together.

If you still don't agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun, You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friend over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend through basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related.

Most likely you won't like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it. Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you. Sometimes the club isn't fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one. Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no one knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone. Cause everyone won't be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you don't known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them. When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them.

So what we know is that joining an after school program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could join for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.

F4EA60BCBC2C,"Many people prefer to work in a group, because they think it can be more helpful, and others people said that they prefer to work alone. There are some benefits of working in a group and working alone. I think that the best option is to work in a group.

When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster.

Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily.

In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group and you can learn more from your ideas.

Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate and they can learn faster.

In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting,when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own.

B7075CD10BCC,"In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody. We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime

Many student don't like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I don't think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they don't pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life.

Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you.

For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe

This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience.

In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more. Study is more important, the place is not important beacuse when the person want to be someone like a professional in the future they need study much.",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

some day of this week my friend bring a pants and i'm saw him, my fist empression was ''naa this not going which you , so i will honest with him , if somebody tell me something that is not pleasing for me i'm sure that i going to put my impression face , and maybe the other person don't like, but it's impossible to change my impression , I will direct which the people ,if the people don`t like my impression i'm sorry for them, yeah maybe it's not correct to say the fist impression , i'm agree for that too, and i understand that some people put angry when i do that , but i can't change my actituded because i'm like this, it's the same with the another people they got them own impression but in different ways , that's fot that i'm agree , and i understand that is so important to me beacuse i don't know if the other person feel bad when i say the first impression , that's why i need to improve my impression , some people and my friends are annoying with me for this , and that's why i need to practice respect to myself and the another people.

The fist impression is bad idea because if i'm in the job and my boss tell me that my work is not like this, and i say my fist impression that's sure that my boss will put annying because maybe he try to teach me, and the fist thing that i do is my impression and is not a good imprression,

some impression are good because when somegirl look beautiful my impression going to be wow i like how they look today , so impression can be good or bad,

the impression can used in different ways, can use in possitive and negative forms so we decide what kind of impression to used , but a lot a time we only used a negative impression in that is not correct , for example if i or some friend bring something or do something we need to do an possitive impression but we always give a negative impression and that is not correct we need to encourage this person but we only do negative things.

Having a godd impression we are more than we can imagene because everybady respect to you and nobody got problem with you , and thats a opportunities to alot of ways in your life .

4ACFA2D3D0A1,"In my opinion I believe that it is better that we accomplish more it will make us more active. Im a firm believer that inactivity does not serve any purpose. This is the reason there is daylight and also nighttime; when its day time you get things done and when its nighttime you can rest or spend time relaxing. I also seen that the more you do the less you are to complain. Now let me explain to you some reasons why you should always accomplish a lot through out the day.

My first thing I would like to start with is that there was a study at ""The University of Florida"" it showed that a person that does completes lots of tasks usually does better academically. Also you can get stressed if your not doing lots of work suffer health issues being active is important. The university tested 40 students 20 of them would show up to class on time get assignments done and come everyday. They would also be inspired to do better with there studies.

It is also sometimes good to be inactive but that would mostly be during the night time when you have had a long days work you can sit down and just relax.

Being a active person also makes you a more preferable person when you are working. People tell you that you are a hard worker when they see that you are doing your work on time. You are also preforming to the best of your availability. At my work I had this conflict with my co worker and instead of me arguing I just told her she was right and let it go. This lady would always be angry because her work she would be stressed out and yelling but that again comes in with being a lazy person.

Being active can keep you out of trouble or addiction because you will not be so bored throughout your days. You will keep your head so busy that you will be so tired that you wont think about anything else just about taking rest and going home. Keeping bust is also a huge stress deliver because it makes your brain process things more quickly. Unlike with being inactive you just stay at home and do not do anything. Your brain will just be thinking all day about what it will do and you will get worried from not doing anything throughout the day. These are some of the reasons I believe it is good to be positive and not to be to worried.

It is always good to consider why the night time and the day time was made the sunlight was to keep us awake and then the dark was made to make us fall asleep. Also keep in mind that the time you spend doing nothing can be put for good use and you can never take back the minutes or hours that you have spent doing nothing. These are some of the reasons it is always good to be a active human being so that you do not have any problems later in life.                   ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0

Getting to know who the person is by askin them about them self not just be like of there not good enough. For a example if someone is tired and your gunna be like oh their lazy you cant just base them from there firsr impresstions.

Is it impossible to change no its not impposble because it i ur mentality. In life nothing is inpossible you can easily chnage to a whole diffrent lets say, your a very mean person you can always change and be super nice to everyone. You can always change for who you are and for me i was very quiet i would never wanna go talk to poeple because i was really shy with people but now i like to talking to everyone else and i dont care who the person is i always introduce my self.

So i strongly agree with this statement you cannot jude someone by their first impressions some people thought i was really mean when they first met me bcause i would be tired end of the day and i wouldnt walk people because i was lazy and i didnt have that enery to talk. Thats why i changed my mentality so people would not call me lazy because its anoying so thats why i changed my whole life around i didnt wanna be so the same so i just changed, that made me super happy just for having a new life style.

When someone says it is impossible to change their wrong because they dont belive in them selfs that they can change has a new perosn i didnt think i was going to be a whole new diffrent person. and now i do really like who i am always smileing. Back then i would not like to smile i was a really boring person. I wont lie i have based poeple have their first impressions and be like dam there not cool people and end of the day they are cool people.

02B36EBD5C66,"Students can benefit from this option, but also can affect them in different ways. Many students have difficulty coming to school every single day. One impediment may be transportation, a lot of them do not know how to drive, so they can not drive to school. Some students live in areas where the buses can't enter. Many of them walk to get to school every day or ride a bicycle. They face many problems but the biggest one is weather. The climate can change quickly, when is raining a lot or is cold these students stay at home, because there is no way how they can get to school.

Students can benefit by not attending everyday to school. For students who live far away from school is a great option, because they safe time and also they can work during the day. As we see many students have a job after school, and this is hard for them because they have to be active in school. There is a big problem because they come tired to school, and you see them sleeping in classes. They can not be concentrate because they do not have time to sleep. Many of them do not have time to do homework, or different projects they have to complete.

It is a great option to have schools that offers distance learning. This action help many students but also can affect them. In my opinion when you attended to school everyday you can learn more. Because you have all the resources you need to understand, and complete the assignments. But students who like to work hard and take their time to studying in their houses, it can also be easy for them.

Before that there was not technology is was extremely hard. Now that the science had grown up, and the technology appear, we have a way more opportunity to do many things. One opportunity is to studying online from our houses. As I said now that we have technology, we have more opportunities and is really easy to find stuff that you need to learn in your school.

In my conclusion, I think is good for our society having those school who offers distance learning. Because many students can not be in school everyday, and this action help them to keep studying. If this program does not exist many of them could never go again to school, because of all the impediments they have to attend school, and they will never accomplish their dreams.

Being your self and not letting the world to try to make something else, is something that will bring goods in your future, because is something that you choose and you know why did you took it and why did you choose it. However, the peoples that let the wold to choose for them they will get tire about life.

The second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you. If you want to do the greatest accomplishment in your life you should take something that you that you like to do. because when you do something that you like to do you will never going to get tire about doing it, when you like to do something and you wanted to be the greatest accomplishment, you are not going to feel that job like a job because is something that you like to do. But to make that happen and accomplish that dream. never led the world to do what ever it wants with you.

Being your self and not letting the world to take control over your life, the best choice that you can do, because being yourself and choose your own decision will help you to know what to do,what's good , what's bad, what career to choose, and what goal to accomplish because the only person who know all about you is you. So you should not let the world to ruin their life, and take their own decisions and tell the world that you can do it in your own. Lots of people let the world to choose for them and in future they ruin their life and they don't know whats to do for not choosing the correct choice and because they let the world to choose for them.

In conclusion, never led the world to change your life . because if you led the world to choose for you you will never going to get satisfy. Always be your self because if you led the world to choose for you will have a bad and sad feature for for not choosing the right decision. Always do a things what you like to do, like sports or a profession that you would like to be, if you choose things that you like you never going to feel it like a job. sometime you let the world to choose for you, but in the future you will get bored because you did not choose what you like. If you want to make real the greatest accomplishment, never led the world to change you. ",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0

What are the disadvantage and others benefit that could help them.

This position take care to all the people that don't like to do nothing with specifics ways some pelople have differents things that could be like lazy like , Many students are lazy to do their homework people that are lazy to work and they have to do it because it's necesssary for our life , Also the peolpe who have that study in university they like more go to a party people like that only want go to places that are funny or sleep the whole day in many countries people still with that the people who have a dream in their lifes and not strive to do it now who have opportunities that are young can strive for they want for their lifes in their futures , about the information that we can find it in Google about this topic also is a procedure that they can take to have energy I think also could be anemia and they could eat well .

58EF6CAF956B,"Do you want to know the reason why it is important to have someone who can share wisdom and experience with you? Well, I know there are a lot of reason. The benefit of having someone who shared wisdom and experience with you is that, people will show new things, you will get an opportunity to learn new things, and you won't feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this.

When my friend shared how she overcome being alone, because she couldn't speak English well, I realize that I can overcome being alone too. It was hard for me to talk with the other kids, because I was afraid that they will laugh at me, because I couldn't speak well, and then my friend says ""try to talk with them, otherwise you won't be able to speak with them,"". After that, she told me If I want to communicate, I need to be confident. Like that, She shared her experience.

The another benefit is that you can learn new things from the person who shared their wisdom to you. When they tell you about their experience, you will gain strength from it and you won't be afraid to do new things. When the people who tell you about their experience see you doing new things, they will support you, so that your experience will be memorable.

There are times when you feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this, but when someone tells you about their story, you will feel that you are not the only one who is feeling like this. When they shared their story, you will gain an opportunity to make new friend. You two will share your feeling about the experience and become closer. On the other hand, the funny and the sad stories will make you two have fun while you talk.

Since you know that there are a lot of reasons to share your experience, I wish you could use them to share your wisdom in the future. Don't you think it is the time for you to seek and ask other people's experience?                  ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0
E0E060143B79,"Do you think failure lead you to do better? In this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. Failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. Also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success.

First of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. For example; in freshman year i remember that i couldn't actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. I even stayed after school, I was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. However, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class.

Secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. When you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesn't actually goes the way you had planted. For example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution you're supposed to get. Although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. However, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life.

Finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. For example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time you're losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal.

In conclusion, some people said that failure doesn't lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. Going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success. In the future never stop trying without losing enthusiasm because enthusiasm is the key of your success.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

I like to go to Mexico because there so much to do and it's really fun. When i go over there i do a lot of stuff every single day like hang out with family, go to the plaza, go to the beach, go to the movies, go rollerskating, go to downtown and shop over there, and many other stuff.

My favorite thing to do over there is to help the bakers make bread and also to be with my family. Mexico also has good mexican food that you will probaly like. There are other places i would like to travel to but i choose Mexico because it's my moms hometown, theres a lot to do,and because i get to see my grandma,uncles,aunts,and cousins. Mexico is my favorite place to visit because i get to hang out with my old friends and go to the pool and swim til i get tired.

When i was little my mom would take me to the zoo a lot with my friends and we would have a blast. Sometimes i wish to live over there cause it's an amazing place to be at, but sometimes i don't cause i would have to go to school over there and i would have to learn how to write and read in spanish, which im not very good at. Mexico is kinda similar to virginia because they have chuck a cheese, mcdonalds, burger king , buffalo wild wings, and taco bell. Back then they didn't have those kind of place but only mcdonalds. Mexico now is so different because theres spray paint on the walls every where and it's just not the same as back then. They listen to american music and kinda talk english. I'm not saying that they can't learn that i'm just saying its just weird cause i just came from america i just want to be in a place where people are talking in there launguge.

EFE2BC73A573,"You think first impression would change a person or not? Some of are stuff that we have right now is because of first impression.

In this essay I will argue about First Impression. Let's said that you go to the store and see something that you fall in love with at first impression and you buy it, but is not what you expect to be as you saw in the store because the commercial lie about the product . Now you don't think the same about the product that you fall in love at first impression.

First, I disagree about First Impressions statement. The feeling of first impressions everybody have it, but is not impossible to change it. I would give you a example of how your first impressions can be change. For example you see a nice car for sale in you way home and you stop by to see the car because you are in love with the look of the car. The owner of the car let you try it and when you get inside, car interior is ruined and a lot engine problems. Now your first impressions is ruined just like the car you thought look nice. Next weak you see another car for sale close to your house, but this time the car does not engine problem and ruined interior like the last car you try. Your first impressions from a car for sale change.

Second, this is my experiences with first impressions. When I was 13 years old I thought that my sister phone have the best camera ever and best software ever. Now in 2019 the new IPhone 11 come out and my first impression with the camera and software was a lot different from my sister phone.

In conclusion I think first impressions can be change. Just try other placer where you can find the same product with best thing. Your first impressions about last change.

Sometimes we are lazy and we don't want to do nothing, but if we are doing always something we can be more stronger and helpful to the citizen.

Sometimes we are lazy, but that is bad in our life because we has to learn about this life and prepare for the future and other things. One day we would grow up and we would does not know anything and we're gonna fall in our life, therefor i told them this advice.

Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""

we can be stronger if we are always doing something because we can learn about everything that we did and we can get strength to be better, also we can be a adviser to other peoples for example: Kids, Teenager, also Adults.

We can be helpful if we are always doing something because one day that we fall down, also we can stand up more stronger and healthy. We can help person with our experiences, also we can help kids give them a advise because we want a good, strong citizen in this world and they can make it better, and help each other.

For example, people will not have to take a bus to visit other people, or walk miles to see other folks, instead they can just call in their phones and have a little chit chat by using tecnology.

Second, is that the tecnology can do part of the work, for example you are writing a note for a paty, ceremony, marry, whatever, and it have to be one for each person, what are you woing to do? just by using the technnology you can print evrithing you want, it makes easy your work, also have more time to do something else.

Third, some benefits of the technology is the time that you spent looking for sonthing or deciding, another benfit is the things that you can learn with all the information that is in the web, ofcourse if you use it properly like it is. You can learn how to be an artist, how to cook, and how to fix something broken.

In addition, sometimes people get addicted in a web and that could be bad, that is when the negative effecs came, people don't know what they are doing when they get adicted to it, that is why people have to know how to use it correctly

Consecuently, the technology is developing more and more, we can built great things for the future and create more, eventually, the tecnology is not the only one that is developing, there is the science too because it help to develop other things and bring protection to people.

I want It to be somewhere that students can come and talk to me whats wrong.

I would also want to go to a good collage to get the education to be a nurse. It is going to be hard to get this job ,but I am going to work for it as hard as I can. I also have to put in a lot of effort into this job to get it. It would at least take me about four years to be in a collage to help me study about how to be a nurse. Being a nurse will be difficult in a many ways, but it's a matter of learning of how to do something. I would say its a better idea if I study longer it would be a most likely that I would get the job.

More ways to be a nurse is by being organized because you need to know what the students need to become a nurse. Also I would need to listen to directions because you can mess up because it's an important job. There are a lot of pros and cons about being a nurse because it's a job where you can mess up you can get into serious trouble. It takes a lot of time to be things that you want to be ,but everything takes times ,so I would say being something that you enjoy and think if you can do it. I would definitely want to be a nurse in a school to prove to the manager that I can do it.

First,some students wanna to stay home for classes this is good thing because you can fouces carfully and take you time and no body can't make you obsess. Some students maybe just need focuse to classes and he can't do in schools and he want to be school home. For Example; We have firend family him name is Generic_Name,Generic_Name wanted to be home school and do work in home. He do like to come school early. He told to him Mother and Father but they are is not agree with him because they says you have to go school and you can learning better and he do not have any option and he start to go school.

Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you don't have any activity to do you you stay home all time. For friendship you can't find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesn't have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor.

Lastly,some teachers like to teach online and I think this is good option to for teachers because maybe teachers can teach better and maybe can foucse better then in class.

For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me.

Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. some students have some physically problem I think they are need home schools because is easy then school because in school maybe somebody push and like some accident. For the physically students schools home is good because they can learning easly and they can focause better and nobody obsses.

Finally it gets harder collage, you get to pick your collage, And you need to work hard and earn your degree to become what you want to become in life, also earn your diploma.

After collage where are you going, what do you want to do, how do you want your life to be like. lats say Im a doctor, I go to work at my favorite job, I make money for me and my family with out your degree and diploma, I cant work there I need to go to collage to earn it and work hard for it also to never give up for what I want.

most in portent part in your life is your family.

The money you make by your favorite job goes to your car, house,things you need, work, and your kids, they go to school and do the same thing you did, they learn how to read, write, speak, and more its like a circle, First elementary school, then middle school, and high school, finally collage,

First of all, I support the idea on students choosing a career before they get to start high school.

That wey they will know, what they like to be when they graduate from high school.

For example some students will became profetional sport players, architects, doctors, etc.

Because thinking on becaming some one very important in the society at a young age will make them proud of them selfs, and that woul lead them in to a succesifull pat.

Secondly, for young students will be easier to get to where they want at a youn age.

Because they are young, they don't have to think a bout anyting ells but studying.

For example they don't have to think a bout payin bills, or taking care of the family.

The only thing they have to worry a bout is studying, and follow their dreams to be what they want to be.

In conclution, this are my reasons on why I support the idea that the student need to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

There are a lot of way you should find to do something, and even if you would not undertand what you are doing. Don't give up, because one day you will realize your dream. For this subject I do not agree with it, because if you're making mistake often that doesn't mean you will never grow up. Sometime you have to force yourselfe to work, and in life you need to keep moving on, in what you're doing, you have to make sure that you never go back in the past, because you would like to realize your dream that you promised yourself in the future.

For this position you may say that if you are trying to do something, and you already know that it is not going to be right, just leave it until you find the right way to do it. If you have an experience to do something, and prove it you need to think about it first, before you try your best in what you were trying to do. You could have done something that you had to do. You have to check it, so to make sure it is good or not good, so that is the way you can learn from your mistakes.

Most of the time, you feel like you cannot do anything all you can do is just sleeping that does not mean you will never grow. You will grow in a good situation, if you are always doing good things and you never do something wrong. Now you will be growing up, and people will appreciate you everywhere you go to. For example you have already done some stuff that you are not supposed to do, life is going on that does not mean you will never grow. If you already have a plan to do something you need to think about it, before you start doing it.

CFBD5DD8ECFD,"Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.

I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks.

The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didn't have time because of school. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family.

The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. For example I love to go out with my friends in spring because it's close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. In addition I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I don't get tired and get bad grades in school.

In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round. ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0

Now others, just wish for money or want the job that pays the most but I do not. I want this job because I think I could really be happy with this job, I could feel like i have a purpose in life with that job, also as an added bonus I could be near the police force, and i have always admired the police force because of their bravery. thats why this is going to be what I want to accomplish.

First and foremost, I want this job because I could truly be happy. I love working by myself because I would get to work at my own pace and not have to worry about slowing down for others. And I really feel this is a good way of helping to get justice without getting in the action. For example I could help the police catch criminals by helping with fingerprinting. And thats why I feel I could be happy with that job.

Additionally, I would take that job because I would always get to be around the police force. And I admire them so much for their courage and bravery. something that we have in common is that we both want to help people. One time i saw someone take someones purse and the police officer chased him and pinned him down and returned the purse. The way I see police officers is that they love to help other people.

Lastly, and the most important to me, in this job I would get to feel that I am helping people on a regular basis by getting justice for them. Because most of the time I just hate myself for not helping others more often. People deserve better than me but I can not change over night so all I can do right now is hope, that in the future I can be better. But in the meantime the things I can do are the little things because those are the things that count the most.

In summary I can tell you the future is under control for me I have a dream an I hope I can accomplish it. On another note the future is in all of our hands if we work together that future can be the brightest it can be. We can all decide what we want to do or be but we can be nice and to me thats all that matters. I hope whoever is reading this has a wonderful dream too.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,3.5
5AC1AB0965F6,"Ever since I was little I would dreamed of going to Hawaii. I would always think of seeing the beautiful crystal clear blue seas. I would want to go scuba diving and get a view of the animals in the ocean.

reasons why I would want to go to Hawaii because it has a huge water park. I always have fun at water parks because it has big slides and big pools and other fun stuff. But Hawaii water park is like three times the size of the water parks I've been in. During the summer I like to go to my pool and spend my time there. I always wished I had a slide in my pool. But my pool is still fun. I invite my friends to make the pool more fun. We play sharks and Minos and other games.

Another reason why I would go to Hawaii is because I want to try out their sea food. I heard their sea food is really good and it come fresh out the ocean. Personally my favorite sea food is crab. But i like crab better when its a crab soup.

One more important reason why I would want to go to Hawaii is because I want to spend time with my family. I rarely get to spend anytime with my family. The reason that is because I have to go to school and my work and stuff. Then my when i comeback home my dad has to go to work. He comes back around midnight. So basically I never get to see him. I probably see him like for 10 minutes but then I cant. At least I get to see him during holidays.

The first thing I would want to do when I get to Hawaii is go to the huge water park. I want to go there to have fun. I also want to ride all the slides in the park. I want to play around with my family and have fun with them. Me and my dad always go on big slides when we're in a water park.

Another activity I would want to do when I get there is ride a bike around the city i'm gonna be staying at. I want to get to know the city and all of its locations. I also would love to ride on the mountains so i can get a nice view and take some photos.

Something else I would do is swim in the crystal clear oceans with my family. I have never seen my feet when i'm in the ocean and i want to experience that. I also want to have fun throwing a ball around with my family.

The first things I would want to see in Hawaii is go scuba diving and get to see the beautiful sea creatures swim around the ocean. Also for reason I want to get to touch them, and I want to see my families reaction. I always wanted to sea wild sea creatures. I never get to sea them because the closest ocean to me is dirty so you cant see nothing under the water. I want to see them swimming around and see other animals in the water. Every time I see a sea creature. The only way I would see one is if I caught it with a fishing rod or its dead on the sand or In the aquarium.

I would really want to go on a helicopter and see all of Hawaii. I just want to explore and get a beautiful view of Hawaii. At least see two dolphins hop from the ocean. That would be a perfect moment. But I just want to see Hawaii. I would probably go see one of does fire performance too.

One more thing I would want to go see in Hawaii is my family having fun. I want to see them having fun because I rarely get to see them having fun. We usually don't have fun because were not always together. One of my family membesr has to work and the other has to do something else. I really wished we could spend time longer together.

If you mess up and make a mistake you will learn not to do it again. It's better if you make mistakes insted of being perfect because you can't learn and better yourself. We all make mistakes once in a while that's why we learn from them. You shouldn't let your mistakes hold you down. You should let your mistakes better you. Don't try to be perfect. If you do you will just end up never learning from an experince. When you make a mistake, adapt to how you can fix it and don't make that same mistake. This is one of the reasons why a problem is a chance for you to do better. Another reason is You learn not to make the same mistake twice.

You make a mistake and you learn from it. It's fine if you make another mistake just don't makr the same mistake again. If you make the same mistake twice you could get in trouble. When you make a mistake and learn from it you grow. Don't take a mistake as a flaw. You become wiser from a mistake. You become a better and smarter person. This is why a problem is a chance for you to do better.

The last reason is you improve yourself. You let yourself learn more instead of feeling like you can't come back after that mistake. Your mistakes become positive because you learn so much. Mistakes were never meant to be flaws. They werer always meant to be learnd from. Mistakes help you become a better person by learning from them.

ED9C6EDC5601,"Adding another hour and thirty minutes to the school schedule is just a waste of time! It means having to miss time with my family. It also means having to wake up earlier to get to school. Teachers would have to stay back and work longer but probably get paid the same amount for ten hours. So I disagree with having to add another hour and thirty minutes.

First of all I don't think kids would like to wake up extra early and get ready for school. Once the students get to the school they would be half asleep and it would be harder for them to focus. The students would have trouble staying awake and they would have more attitude then what they have now. More students would be marked tardy and there would more students skipping classes just to get some sleep. Not every student would stay awake through out the day and finish there work.

Adding an hour and thirty minutes would also have an impact on teachers. They already have to wake up extra early in order to be here on time and stay late to work on grading papers, going to meetings, etc. It would be harder for them to stay awake and teach. Teachers don't even get paid enough. So why would they want to stay back and serve more time.

Some after school activities would get canceled and student that would need those after school activities would get mad. Complaints would start coming in and parents would get mad and ask why their child is failing. Some sports would be canceled and and athletes would get frustrated because they won't be motivated or asked to go to a certain collage. Students would get low grades if after school activities were to get canceled. The school would become a laughing stock.

Adding an hour and thirty minutes would have a bad effect on the school and the people in it. There would be more trouble then there is now and students wouldn't get motivated. Grade levels would go down and students won't focus. Teachers would have trouble staying up for ten hours. Family time would be shortened as well.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.5

Play games like soccer, football ride a bike, make running races with your friends, or baseball, play music but not so loud because the police may come, invite you son/daughter boyfriend/girlfriend and their parents to come to the park, maybe bring some snacks for the afternoon. Spending time outdoors with your family and friends is like having a camping day, is there is a river that you are allowed to fish, it will be a great idea to go fish and catch some fish to eat them, but the most important thing is to have fun with all your friends and family. To admire how beautiful is the nature, to forget all your problems while listening to the sound of the birds reconnect with you family and to remember how important is to the love of your family and friends, Because some people don't have family and friends and there are all alone that's why is so important how much the people around you that appreciate you so much and you have to be so thankful for that. In the night you can make fire to put mash mellow to the fire and than eat them with cookies one on top and the other one on the bot on and while eating the mash mellow the people can make a large group to tell scary story maybe some jokes but the best at the end the best part of being outdoors is the you are having fun fun with your friend and family, but also you are breathing fresh air from the nature. Community parks, state parks, and national parks are very important for the community because is a place where someone can have fun while their are with their friends, with their boyfriend/girlfriend, or with their wife/husband you can make a party, you can go run, walk with your dog or just take a walk yo relax your brain and refletionate and to forget about all your problems for just a moment and I think parks are place that we have to take care of because thats where are the home of some birds animals and plants to grow.

There is a debate between people who thinks should people more accomplish then inactive. Some people believes their journal will take them to their destiny and they doesn't have to accomplish any thing. It doesn't matter for some people to make decisions and others think different. Because they think their destiny will take them to where they should be. In other hands, I believe what Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote shows me why we have to make our decision so fast and not let to wait. Because we don't know what will happen in the future. We have to being more active, so it will help the country economy. When we are active the country rules and powers can change. Being active is optimal for immigrants too because it help them to learn new language. People always have to take life seriously because how they will know there will be a tomorrow. We should try to make decision before our destiny makes one for us.

First,

when people are more active by working hard it help the economy of a country. Many people accomplish succeed by working hard in difficult environment and it is beneficial for a country to have some excellent active workers. By accomplishing more succeed in your job they can rise your salary. In other jobs they always honor those who are working so hard. It's less chance to be loser. To find sussed everything basically inside your hand. When people accomplish more is not just for their beneficial it is for their country too.

Second, In the past women didn't have any rights in to the government until ninetieth amendments. Before women were inactive and that leave them behind, but after while they start having job in the government branch by protecting their rights. When women start being active it help them to accomplish more success. In America women are having more rights than any other country because they were fight for their freedom. In my own country which is Generic_City, women are afraid of men because women are not active and they never try to having voice in public. Still today men are making decisions for the women and treat them like a slave person, Some female from my country try to being active to make a differences in my country.

Third, some of immigrants try to be an active in their life by moving into another country. For immigrants it doesn't matter to accomplish more or not they just want a basic life. When my mom made the decision to move to the United State I was afraid to learn English and my mom use to tell me you can do it if you really wants to learn. When I first start school in U.S I was so nervous about how can I introduce my self to the teacher because I wasn't able to say hello even in English, but I trust my mom and everything changed. Finally, I get the success and that makes me really happy.

In conclusion, we all will find the success by working hard and not let anything make feel us failure. By accomplish more you will be succeed just don't lose your self. Be hard work and an active person is better than acting like loser. When people inactive they always behind of others and their life is meaning less. People should always accomplish more because there should be a line between who wants win and who wants lose.

While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends.

All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else can't. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer.

Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it.

Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. When students pick their design they don't need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project.

People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasn't fun for no student. That's why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students.

While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful.

The phrase that Duke Ellington said is a good phrase and i totally agree with it because the problem you have or that you will get is a chance for you to do you best at fixing it or solving because the problem will give you a chance to do your best unlike if you come across a problem of just get a problem and you dont try to fix it or dont care or sit back and just watch your problems just pile up and then problems just come and come one after another then you have more then one problem and its just better if you do good on your first problem and you fix an if its big problem and you over come it at the end you will feel great like Duke Ellington he is now legend at jazz music and you know t is not easy to get were he got to be called a legend at jazz music and on his way to the top to become a legend all ways remembered every were you go for he had to over come lots of problems the hate the way he was going to play jazz were he would play his jazz to start up who could give him a boost or help with the jazz to be known more around him were he would get more new instruments money for a place to keep all his music how would he sell his music and all those problems he had to over come and fix and he still made it to his dream and know he is legend.

In conclusion when there is a problem its good to do your best at it or any problem even if you have more then one problem just over come because in the end it will turn out to be a happy ending.              ",2.5,1.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
59E62F702421,"Students should be allowed to do that because they want to learn so much from the professions. They want to learn because this could be their future if they want to. Schools should often do it and will affect these students careers. Kids have these types of dreams that they want to do and learn to get into. They often have the right to ask anybody why these things will help students have a good career and a college degree. The main reason is that this can help kids so much and tell their parents what they learn.

The reason why schools should allow to do this so that kids can go to college and when they are done they can do the job forever and they get the emotion inside of them. Learning so much is the only thing that should help students in school to get all the information inside of their head so that can get them where they want to be. Some don't really have a good thing what they want to do when they are trying to think what they want to do in their life, but it can be a hard choice to decide. Things can really get so good when ever we decide what we tell our parents what we want to do for our lives and other people's too. What we think is that when we go out in the world and see what we think about or something that shocks you when you get so surprised about it and you get it in you head and thats what you want to do.

The job that kids want to do when ever they grow up is the only thing they want to do or something else that's more better than the other one. Things can often have many reasons why kids should get jobs and buy their own things so parents don't have waste any more of their money on them. It's a good thing that parents should make kids work for a job to get money and save up to go to college and have a good time. The thing is that schools have the right idea to teach kids what they should and what they should learn about. This is why it's the right idea to make schools teach students other things that they should. For kids that wanna play sports should really work hard on keeping track on what they should do at school of homework, projects and many other stuff. It's a good thing that kids should keep track on what they to do in order to pass the grade and graduate.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5

EE392BB6CFD1,"kind,caring,nice. Those words explain the meaning of a person if they are trying to be their self. Although some people may think its okay to be yourself in a world where its always trying to change you , nevertheless , some people may think is not okay to be in a world where its trying to always trying to change you into something else because people should express them self how they want to they shouldnt be in a world where its constantly trying to make them into something else and people should live how they wanna live.

For example , people should express them self how they want to be they shouldnt be in a world where its constantly trying to make them into something else. People have all right to be who they wanna be but if you in a world where it is trying to change you that is not a great accomplishment. Clearly people should be who they wanna be.

Therefore , people should live how they wanna live. Everyone picks how they wanna live in a world some people pick to live in a world where people get to pick who they wanna be and some people pick for them self who they wanna be. But its NOT okay to live in a world where everyone picks for you u not making a great accomplishment for yourself.

DE921CECE21A,"Do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, I agree with this. Accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, It also helps us learn more about ourselves. Although, people believe that being in-active is better because it provides less stress and more free time, It also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy.

Being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. In some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. In other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. Having this kind of mindset it good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. A personal experience would be when I was so tired one afternoon, but I had to keep myself from napping because I had homework due. After I completed that one homework, I was too awake to even sleep; So I decided to knock out other work I had in the meantime. In the end I received a better grade from that class and I had chores finished from that week so I didn't have to do anything in the weekend. To conclude this paragraph, when I accomplished one thing I ended up accomplishing more than I expected.

We all have our different ways of living and learning. One way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. You learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and You learn how your own mind works. For example, When I was in my sister's sixteenth birthday party, I also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and Sol's to focus on. For me it was a pretty hectic schedule, but I learned how to respond and manage my time. Learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. Everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how I live and learn.

Although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, It influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. To procrastinate put off something that should be done, To leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. Procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. Being unprepared isn't the best way to live. Having more free time can have it's positive outcomes, but also its negatives. For example, who wants to accomplish nothing now, only to do the same in the future? People may believe being in-active is a better way to live because it relieves you from stress and work, but doing nothing can follow with other bad habits that can lead to worse in your future.

In conclusion, we accomplish more by keeping busy. Keeping ourselves busy can help us prepare for our future, and help us learn more about ourselves and how to respond to a hectic lifestyle. Although some people would like to live a lifestyle doing absolutely nothing, that wouldn't be the case for all. Others would prefer to accomplish more by staying active and helping themselves prepare for whatever comes next.                     ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
6CA2ADCE9A7F,"Do curfew keep teenagers out of trouble and safe, or do they unfairly interfere in young peoples lives. And why is it good or bad for them.

In my opinion I think it would be bad for them If teenagers stay until after 10 p. m and not having a curfew, so it is good for them to have it because of these three examples.

If this was a law I think it would be good for them to have the curfew because they will have a time limit and they'll know what time to not go outside, because if the stay outside until after 10 p. m they are basically breaking the law.

I think it will be good for them because if they don't have it it will interfere their lives and their life schedule. And it will make them and keep them unorganized about everything. Because they can't sleep well, they won't have enough energy to keep up with their daily works.

In my opinion it will be good for them to have it because, it would be more safe for them and they will be more safe and it will keep them away from danger and trouble. Because they will know that after 10 p. m it might not be safe for them.

In conclusion it is good for the teenagers to have a time limit or a curfew for them to go outside. Because it will keep them safe and out of trouble. And it will make them and keep them organized. And the point is that if it was a law. It would've be better for them.

These are my three reasons to , why it's good for the teenagers to have a curfew and make them a time limit for them to go outside.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
ABF21C9A2160,"Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said."" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement."" I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms.

First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we can't stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes.

Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We can't just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance.

In conclution I must said that I agree with Enderson's quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty.

EA42A6028804,"People argue whether or not its a good idea for students to study or identify a carrier of their choice when entering high school. I agree that students should commit to a career of choice when entering high school because they'll be ahead in life than many other students who dont get the opportunity to chose a career they want to learn in high school and studying their choice of career at a younger age would have them college ready.

Learning a specific carrier at the time when entering high school is very beneficial to students because it would have students who do chose to learn a carrier would have them very much ahead of students who their high school's dont even offer the opportunitie to learn a carrier during their years of high school. Learning and mastering a career of choice is something that students should take for granted because once mastered it can lead u to many opportunities while your in high school or have graduated. These opportunities can lead you to Paid internship programs, college scholarships, and even a Job right after high school.

Students who get to study a career of choice during their high school career would prepare them for college. Having students identify a career during there high school years would give them a better feel to go to college right after high school. Your resume would look much more achievable when colleges see you have earned a certificate for mastering a career you choose to learn during your time in high school. Learning something you want to do in the future would prepare you for college because it would almost be the same as attending a college, but without all the nice technology or lab equipment colleges or universities have.

Others would disagree when i say that students should identify a career of choice when entering high school and I understand why. While some parents would want there child to study a career earlier in life, other would recommend that they shouldnt be pressured in to choosing some sort of career when entering high school because it can be really stressful for the students to already having to chose a career to pick right after middle school and other parents want there kid to enjoy life as teenager and then worry about that later. The first reason I understand, but picking a career of choice is super beneficial to that student because studying it and then getting a certificate to when passed the class will lead you to many opportunities during your years in high school and would put you ahead of many others.

This is why I believe students should identify a career when entering high school. It puts them ahead of the game and prepares them for college and the future. I also believe that we should have every high school in the United States offer some sort of options of careers that students can take during there high school career and that the schools can teach in all high schools around America.

BDF13939FA26,"Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life.

If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

From my own expierence, when i was 14-15 years old i wouldnt do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didnt lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. Now that im 17 years old i keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part time job, which wont cause a negative effect on me because im preparing myself for my future and life goals.

It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always.

Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes.

Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school.

Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer.

In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable.

I believe they should never loss enthusiasm, because one day they can be success,learn how to no give up, and that can help you with your goals.

First, i should no loss enthusiasm, because all people have failure, but if you never loss enthusiasm one day you can be success in my life i had failure,but i never give up, becuase i know one day i going to became something better. when i come to united state was hard for me for the lenguage, and learn different things, but the most difficulty in high school was to learn english, but i never loss my entthusiasm, and now i'm about to see everthing that i have done, becuase this year is my graduation.

Second reason, is the people can learn how to no give up, becuase if you have failure thas how you learn that you need enthusiasm to keep going everyone would have failure in their life,but as i'm telling you keep going one day you would see why you have try hard,but you always have to failure first, and then you learn have to no loss your enthusiasm.

The final reason is, that can help you olot in the future with your goals, and you can be success in my oppinion people dont like to failure, and they give up.

Another reason why Robotics is a job for me to pursue, because it's all about coding. Furthermore, coding is basically you have to type in the words specifically. For example, Forward = (1). That means it tells the robot to move forward only one time. Also, coding is like math, you have to calculate what distance is the Robot is going to do and where it want to stop.

Another reason why Robotics is the one thing that I'd like to pursue is Building. Building the Robot is where you have to work with a team to make it happen, if you were to build it by yourself, it would take a long time to make, since it's only you and not 3 or 4 people helping you. Building is like Lego, but you have to screw in nuts, and not connecting them together like plastic bricks. Also, building the robot is most important, because if you screw something up, you have to remove every part of the robot to fix that one mistake you did.

Student's dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Student's come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Student's take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Student's would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. The student's can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. This can also help the student's with computer skill while doing online school. Student's would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. A other good reason is that the student's can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time student's dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning.

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow.

My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken.

When the food is Balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something Health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body.

E4FF635779B8,"People say working in groups is better than working alone, but thats their opinion even though it helps others more than it helps other individual's. I still know working alone is better because all my life i've been working alone since sixth grade. I wasnt really the person to just jump in and meet others or ask for help when i needed them.

Every person has to go through many difficult times looking for a group but, Their just too shy or too nervous to say a word to other people, I would know because i was in the same problem. It can be hard but, the reward is so worth it.

People say working alone has no distractions, finishing faster than others, or learning things on our own. Other individual's say that having no distractions can help them work without stopping but, sometimes there are many difficult situations where we cant do much to work while being distracted, maybe being in quiet place may help. Finishing our work can easily be done without a group, like in our jobs, an office, or even at school. Not everyone has a group to be in except for people that know each other , They have many people that wish to be in a group like them. Back then when i was a little boy, I didnt know English so it was harder for me to understand teachers, or even students till i met two other kids that spoke the same language as me. I was happy to actually find two people that speak the same language as me but, that didnt last long because i never got to see them again. Till then i worked alone, avoiding others, sticking close to myself, even studying alone without anybody. My mother or father couldnt help me as much. That made things worse for me. Thats how i learned to do things all on my own without help. In a quiet place, We'er able to finish other assighment's from our jobs or school work. Teachers and students love to be in a quiet place because it helps them concentrate more than being in a group.

In conclusion working alone is better than working in groups. next time try working on alone, in a quiet room. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0
CD47F64F2398,"The benefits of working with a group and why you should find a group to complete your assignment isn ted of doing it alone.

It's really beneficial to be with a group because of everyone collaborating. Working with a group makes the assignments to be completed in a easier and a faster way. Having a lot of people in a group means that everyone is going to be sharing their thought and ideas of how to complete the work in a easiest way. Working alone means that you have to work harder more responsibilities and also it will take you much more time to complete your assignments sense you are doing everything by yourself.

Being with a group allows others to collaborate with each other that means that no matter how hard the assignments are all together are going to be able to complete it. Having a group guarantee you less responsibilities as well because you have others whom can do a different task from what you are doing. Also being with a group guarantee you to complete the work in much less time that if you were to do it alone. A group gives you better understanding of what you all have to complete do to everyone strong thought and ideas.

Something really important in a group is the Lieder someone who is responsible to check if everyone in a groups is done with their assigned task. Also having a lieder will be easy to assign each one a task without everyone complaining about doing the work. You can also contact you lieder to inform him that is going to be impossible for you to complete your assigned task do to a problem with your family so that way a lieder can inform the others and find someone who can take you task and finish it, if you were alone you would not be able to complete that sense you wouldn't have anyone to depend on. A group guarantee you success when it became to complete any assignments do to everyone effort and sharing ideas, sure a lieder might be important but with a a group the lieder is nothing so everyone is really need in a group in order to successfully complete the work.

Overall working with a group give you much more benefits that be working alone. Being on a group give you a better understanding of what the work is all about do to everyone ideas, also you have less responsibilities including much less time to complete your given assignment.

E847B658E4DA,"Is it important to express your emotions? Is it good to live a healthy life? The way you move, the way you control your movment is all up to you. Is this activity enjoyable for you?

First, this activity has been done by everyone in the world. Which is dancing, everydody at least dances once in their lives. As we speak some people take this activity to the next level. Performing at competitions or shows people pay to watch. This activity is not only enjoyable but educational for those who seek interest in dancing. There are so many things you can learn froming dancing like tap, ballet, hip pop, jazz, and ballroom dancing and more.

Second, you express your emotion, all that anger and sadness you hide, you put that into your dance its what makes it special. Do what your body tells you to do, let out whatever it is your feeling, let your emotion tell a story. Its like writing a story in a book but the only thing different is that you are moving.

Third, dancing takes alot of energy, so that means you have to have a good meal before you can dance. Streach your body so you won't pull a muscle, which can be very painful and sometimes can lead to surgery. After streaching, warm up yourself so you can build your stigma, it will help you when you are feeling weak and tired. Always drink water because you are always sweating and you need to hydrate your body.

Fourth, when you are dancing there is never a right to wrong. Its like a test with no answer key, it just keeps going without stoping. Don't doubt yourself because nobody is going to be perfect, if you want to dance like you run the world then trust yourself.

Finally if you enjoy dancing and you have passion, You are going to be unstopable. All you just have to remember is to just have fun and be you. Teach others and show them that if they are feeling alone, they are never alone because you will be right there next to them guideing them every step of the way.

In conclusion this activity is super enjoyable and fun because you will meet new people and you will have new friends and people who share the same intrest as you. Just remeber as long as you, put your mind and heart into whatever you want to do, anything is possible thats why this activity taught me so much about loving myself.        ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
AF98232BDB08,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students shouldn't use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldn't be doing and that won't help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldn't use their cell phones in class is that they aren't learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and won't be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they don't do well on because they haven't been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they can't do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students don't need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they don't need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they won't need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they won't be doing their work they will be doing other things that aren't importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldn't be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldn't be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

Imagine doing something that makes you happy, An doing something your comfortable at an decide what are your capable of doing in life. People believe that each student should required an electives in school cause people believe that this will help the students find what they want to do, Also this will help them find they skills an get opportunities, And importantly this will helped students in future .

Its really important that students should pick any electives they want to do, Imagine students get an electives they dont want to do. This will have the student feel lazy going to class, An when student feel lazy going to class student mostly skip class. When student skip class students will have a bad grade, An when students get a bad grade they get irritated. And they dont have the motivation so they give up and when students give up they will not receive any credit an students needs enough credit to graduate if a student dont graduate high school the students cant go to colleges. An the student cant have a better job , Also companies would not hire them. people who has no job they could be homeless an its very hard. So this is why it's very important students decide what electives they want to do.

People believe that everyone has their special skills. Students should find they skill taking the electives they really good at cause if a student is good at something they will love to go to class, Also going to class will have student have good grades and would like to learned more things and importantly you will receive an credit. An taking the class they good at will have a lot of benefit an opportunities in life, Cause people who has a lot of skill, Most people would love students to work in their companies. For example if students is good at drama company will hire them as an actress an people will get famous, Also have their own movie an this will makes a lot of money out of it . also not only a student can only have one skill you could have a lot of skill just not one but more, An this will help a student. If a student has a lot of experience an know a lot of things this will definitely help them. This one of the reason that students should find their skills .

Future is very important for the students cause when a students who takes electives and doing the electives they like an love to do students would take this opportunities to have a good future after graduating high school, Also College cause this when their adult life would begin and things will be different. And this why its very important student take their skill so future would not be hard it would be easy for students, It would have a lot of hard an rough times but with the skills they would get through it . Also this is when the student begin their dreams, An student could use the skills for a better future and things would not be hard for them cause students would know what they doing and what is going to happen also most student would find their destiny, An their destination they would love to be at.

On the Other hand If you do try your best and the work you completed is good, and someone gives you a lot of compliments then it helps you build a better self-esteem. Therefore you got to be self confident also, why? because if you're self confident and you apply for a job you will manage to be confident that you will get that job, when you go to an interview. If you practice to be self confident It will help you a lot in the near future. If you got an affinity for a type of shoes and someone else tells you they're ugly how will you feel? Of course you will feel some type of way because that's just how the human body works, but you know what? It dont matter what people think. If you Got an affinity for those type of shoes then it dont matter what people got to say about your shoes. At the end of the day its what you like not what other people like. People will always judge you no matter what you wear, what you look like, and how speak. Always remember that only god can judge you. Therefore you should take the negative stuff that people got to say, and turn them into something positive.

If you meet someone and you do something weird theyre gonna remember you as that one weird kid. it can be bad when someone have a bad impression of you when your trying to be their friend. Sometime you can change people impression of you if they get to know to know you.

if your first impression isnt good it can messed up they stuff you do in life like a job interview if you dont a good impression you may not get the job. If you move to new place and your going to a new school, your going to need to have a good impression to make new friends because if your new and a lot of people dont know you and if you do something weird or dumb everyone at your new school is gonna have a bad impression of you and that may cost you to make new friends and sometimes someone may bully you for being weird. Some kids at school have bad impression and people talk about them behind their back and their made fun of them for being weird. Like if your in a sport team and your that one kid who always bragging about how good they are, people around you wont want to be around you if they know your always bragging and they will spread rumors about you and people will stop talking to you if they know you like talking about yourself and people wont want to be your friend. If you wanna ask out the girl you like and she heard you did something to a another girl, shes going to have a bad impression of you and she wont even want to talk you and your tried to ask her out shes gonna reject you.

1CB9668F242D,"There are so many enjoyable ways to spend time outdoors. That is bike riding,skateboarding,rollerskating,

surfing,scuba-diving,camping,hiking,rock climbing, and snow boarding. However,the most people enjoy doing are skateboarding and bike riding. Mostly,during the summer,friends gather around the neighborhood and teach themselves how to skateboard and bike ride.

However,most parents disagree with having their children ride bikes and skateboard. Most parents think that their children are going to get abducted,raped,kidnapped or get hurt. Some parents also think is a good idea for their to children to skateboard and ride bikes outdoors,so they can cope with talking to people. Well I think is a bad idea for children to ride and skateboard in the Summer alone without parental guidance, because it takes a lot of training and focus to bike ride or skateboard. Some people can even scuba-dive if they have the experience. Most people like to spend time outdoors,for example,they can invite some friends over for some barbecue.

People like to spend time outdoors doing fun stuff like Snowboarding. Snowboarding is a cool way of spending time outdoors,because a lot of children like to play in the snow,so snowboarding is a fun way of playing in the snow. There are so many outdoor events like,Easter and partying. A lot of children like to hunt for Easter eggs during Easter,because they find eggs,candy and so on. Sometimes,most people like to go to outdoor-clubbing to chill,relax, and relieve stress. Some other people don't like to spend time outdoors during the night because they either don't have time or they have important things to do.

Mostly,during the Summer,most parents take their children outdoors to teach their kids how to ride their bikes. Eventually,people might find the activities mentioned above enjoyable,because they get to tell their friends their parents thought them how to ride a bike and skateboard,they could assist their friends. People like to spend time outdoors with friends than stay home alone and do nothing. They could try and teach themselves how to ride their bikes. If parents stay outdoor with their children on a campsite,they could make smores with a campfire and enjoy.

In conclusion,people should stay out more often so they can learn how to snowboard,skateboard,bike ride,rock-climb,roller-skating,surfing,camping,hiking,scuba-diving and jet-skiing.              ",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5
E069D2A8AE1E,"Have you had a friend sharing wisdom and experiences with you? You probably had that a million times. Here is the thing though. People just want to learn the experience of you and the others, which isn't a bad thing. It's also important to learn each other's experiences. I think it is important to learn from other people's experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they're in a situation, and you can communicate each other. To clarify this, let's dig in deeper.

First, I think it's important that you understand who they are because you get to know about their favorite hobbies, the places they like to visit, the pets they have and their dream vacation. Getting to know on who the person is can give you a good start off to make a bond, or form friendship between you and that person. If you shared your experiences with a person, they might feel interested on what you're talking about. Telling a person on what you like can bring that person's attention deeper.

Second, it's important that you help the person if they're in a situation because you can cheer them up if they lost a family member. Helping someone out can make that person feel better and most of all, feel comfortable, and they will think that you're a good person. If you didn't reach out and help somebody, they could start getting into a tougher situation where they might not be able to handle by themselves. They could also feel very lonely or left out, and that is not okay.

Third, communicating with others is important because you can text them in Social Media, such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. You can also go shopping with them. Communicating others bring closer friendship, and keep the bond strong between you and you're friend. Watching movies and hanging out at each others house are another examples of communication. They're lots of ways to communicate with your friends and other people, and that is a good thing for friends. Activities is another thing for communicating with other people because sometimes, when people do activities, it provides teamwork.

In Conclusion,

I think it is important to learn from other people's experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they're in a situation, and you can communicate each other. So now that you understand, think about these as you make new friends. Question yourself on how to get a good start to form a bond between you and that person. Try to reach out and help him/her if they need help with something. Make that person feel comfortable by hanging out with them at lunch or at home. They might need good company from you!

The second reason is that I want to inspire other people that might be overweight and give them hope that they can lose weight. My Third and final reason is that losing weight is just better for me in general it would boost my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious.

To better explain my first reason I will talk more about it. The reason was that losing weight would be better for health. You see bad things can happen to you when you are overweight such things as diabetes that is a sickness that is a result of being overweight. Some overweight people find it difficult to walk or to do something simple because they are carrying all that extra weight on them. In fact i sometimes find it hard to do exercises in gym class that most people would find easy to do. There are many heath risks when it comes to being over weight and thats one of the reasons I want to lose weight.

The second reason I want to lose weight is because I would like to inspire other people that are overweight to try and lose wight. If I lost weight that could encourage other people to lose weight as well because they can say to themselves a person who was were I am lost weight and I can do the same. I have a saying it's ""when you help someone you help everyone"" an example for that saying would be if I helped someone want to lose weight they might feel the need to help other lose weight. So I hope that I could influence a sort of butterfly effect starting with me inspiring someone to lose weight and that person inspiring someone else and so on and so on. If I lose weight knowing that I lost weight not only helping myself but also others I would be proud of myself.

My third and final reason to lose weight is that it would be better for my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. If you have any insecurities than you know what is like to want to get rid of those insecurities. One of my many insecurities is my weight and I think that if I got rid of that insecurities it would better my self conscious and make me think good about myself. I just plainly think that I would be better off losing weight because I would think better of my self.

In conclusion one thing I want to accomplish in life is lose weight. There are several more reasons I could list but those are my main and biggest reasons I want to lose weight. I want to lose weight because it's healthy,because I want to inspire people to do the same,and because I want to boost my self esteem.

What you already mastered such as: a Gunsmith, a Formula 1 driver, an Investor, a Stock Broker, a Magician or even a Scientist would tell their own children what do to and what not do to. In fact, tell them to be in their shoes. Generation grows bigger and bigger; Wonder what would happen next.

On the other hand, you might as well encounter something that you never try before, a challenge. In this position, people want to test their master skill to the test. It good thing because you want to prove yourself ,as an expert, that you want to be anonymous person who tries so hard to achieved their goal. People will say ""Dream Big"" or ""Just do it"" that gets people motivate to face their mastered skills to the next level.

Students who are in their comfort zone will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused. Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing.

Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school.

C928D32FE5C5,"Are vacations a necessity to us and to our success? Why do we need them? While some say that inactivity gives us time to reinvent ourselves. Others believe that it instigates procrastination. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up and it allows us time for new ideas.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up. For example, I was once taking a very long test that lasted around 4 to 5 hours. At first, I was just guessing my way through it because I was very tired and ready to give up. Then, we were given a five minute break so I got up and walked around a bit. After walking for a few minutes, I was energized and ready to finish the test. With my new found energy, I was very content with the test and my score. In fact, students who take mental breaks during long testing periods score 31% higher than the ones who did not take any breaks. In conclusion, inactivity keeps us enthusiastic about our work.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it allows us time for new ideas. For example, one of my friends named Generic_Name once did not go to school for three days. During these three days, she organized her school essentials and cleaned up her room. Since she was working on a project before the break, she had time to finish it and she even had another project idea for her science class. She obtained a good grade on both projects. In fact, students who have taken breaks during long tests, like the SOL, say that after their break they had a better understanding of the test. Even the workforce workers are encouraged to take a few days off. It helps the worker get more creative. Even the owner of a business need a vacation. In fact, around 56% of entrepreneurs say that they came up with at least one new idea after a vacation. Inactivity helps prepare our minds for when we are active.

Inactivity serves a purpose. Inactivity keeps us from throwing in the towel. it gives us a mental break; which, creates time for new ideas. Some believe that inactivity encourages laziness. However, it gives us time to rejuvenate our attitude and our mindset. If we take more breaks, to let our mind wonder, we would be more effective in anything it is we are doing.

Also success is not something easy to get, but without loss calm could get it with enthusiasm. Success has an role important in the life of many people since it is something that is necessary in their academic level, their jobs, and their goals to have a better future.

First, success is difficult to get at the academic level, but the students need know that although they are failing with effort they could get it. Since to get it, they need to study a lot without loss the hope of getting success. Also they need to practice each step to do more easy their activities and have a better success. For example: if students loss any test they need to study and practice a lot to get their success with enthusiam. For this reason, the importance of the success also depend of failure to failure to learn.

Second, in the work, the success depend of many dedication and is absolutely necessary working a lot to get it. If the employees is not working well, the problem could be that the company not could have success and the employees could be exonerated of their jobs. Moreover, if they are exonerated their jobs, they need to looking for another jobs without loss the calm to get their new jobs with a great enthusiasm.

Sometimes the success in the work is not easy to get, but neither impossible.

Finally, the people have many goals in their future, but also have obstacles to get success. The goals are difficul to accomplish, but not difficult to do. Furthermore, to realize their goals, they need to keep completely firm their ideas to find the success.

All goals can get with dedication and effort.

In conclusion, from failure to failure, the success can be possible and get it with a great enthusiasm.

Does not matter the difficulty that everything have, the most important is realizing all with success, but without loss enthusiasm.

D7C9E22CC216,"Graduating Early is a Bad Idea

Personally I think graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years should not be allowed. School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad.

Graduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again. Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they won't be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they won't be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out what's good or bad for them economically.

I have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early. Generic_Name goes to college and has trouble adapting to the new environment and dealing with defferent types of people, Generic_Name is having emotional pronlems because she is not sure anymore about what she wants to do in life. Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she can't get a boyfriend because she doesn't know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me she's having economical problems because she's doesn't know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world.

In conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school. Give students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to be ready for the real world.             ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

Also students who take this program they could take classes for the same subject like, English nine and English teen at the same year. However students who take this program and they are going to college they could finish more early college and students who not going to college they can start working more early.

In summer we go to different places with my family, we like to travel, we go to crazy water parks, museums, and we go to the zoo sometimes. when you're in school you don't get a lot of time to spend with your family. because you get busy doing your homework and studying.

Idle or active?

, I think that when you are active you can make and accomplish the duties that you have faster and better.

The reason that i think being active is better, Is because you will get accustomed to always do something and that can help you in your future in your homework, house duties, and in your future job; and i know that being idle does not help you to grow as someone that is uses full to the society, because one of my cousins does absolutely nothing and he start to get into a lot of problems with our family.

If you are always active you are showing to the people that you are someone they can count on, someone that demonstrate, values like determination, and responsibility; and most of the time people are looking for does type of people to manege a work place, food store,school,and companies.

I also think that active people are more likely to be successful,I am sure that it is true because my father star to work when he was only 9 years old and he was always doing something, and then whit the time he reach to be his own boss doing what he like but never stop doing the duties that he give to himself make him a really responsible person; and that why i think that person how are always active have more potential to succeed.

The reason that idle people are not going to get anywhere for me is because most of the time people are looking for somebody with energy and wants of work and if you are one of the people how are always on the sofa watching television i am sure that you wont be the first choices for them.

In conclusion the reason why i chose the people that are active make more accomplishment in they daily life is because that have more opportunities to show to the word that they are here and that they want to be seen and they want something to do and do it better and that they can reach their goals.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5

My name is Generic_Name, I am a freshman at Generic_School. I would like to talk to you about a healthier school lunch menu. Ever since these 4 months have passed I've been eating the school lunch. Every time I eat the school lunch, after 30 minutes I would go to the restroom. The food wouldn't sit right nor feel right in my stomach.

The issue isn't just with me, my friend Generic_Name has an allergic reaction whenever he eats something from the school lunch menu. I believe it would be a good idea to have healthier school lunch menu. Because half of our students at Generic_School are obese. Even you know all the food your providing for us is junk food. The pasta has puddles of oil, the burgers don't taste like real meat, the orange chicken isn't even cooked well. All the food you are providing for us is microwaved food.

Instead of all these microwaved food. We could have similar foods as the ones we have right now for the lunch menu. The foods you feed us should be organic like the bread, meat , spaghetti , etc. The school lunch should be worth $3.75. Dr. Generic_Name instead of thinking about yourself think about us a little bit more. Imagine yourself sitting down at the lunch table seeing a puddle of oil on you're pasta tray. Imagine eating rock hard french fries. Please think about it and call me into your office if you ever want to talk about this issue that 75% of the students are having here at Generic_School.

If students may allow to use cell phone then they can distortion by study, and their force can be in phone. When we keep use phone then we can't listen what teacher saying.

Examples: In the other country they don't use the cell phone in classroom if you use the cell they call your parent or they take you off the school and if you want to study in school you need to listen what the teacher took and they can help you to understand more in classroom .

Examples: Some school they don't care about the other student to use cell phone they want to study in classroom if they want to use cell phone they need to use after the classroom because some student they want to get more experience in classroom the student use the cell phone for chat snap or Facebook but the other student they use cell phone for the read something she/he known in her/him in main.

Examples: The student use the cell in classroom because they don't have anything to do in classroom the student need to have more experience in classroom and if they teach some thing in classroom they can use the cell phone anymore because the other student need the experience in classroom.

The student need more experience in the school if they don't have any experience the other student they will use the cell phone in classroom

5B2FC963E89D,"A person life, is like a little story, there way to think or act goes with what they have been though, some have gone from easiest to harder situations, there are many situations that people go through all the times. There own way to be, the way they go through situations, makes people take decisions or actions that someone that has gone through the same situation can help them inspired or make positive things in there life. Once you go through many situations it will be helpful to be inspired and think in someones life.

There are so many different opinions and ways to influence someone, they can be reasons or things that happened in the life of a person that will not necessary be inspired by a example of someones action, or life. Also a inspiration can make you feel confidence in a situation were you think you do not know what to do. The influence of a person can always be helpful.

A example is only main thing to influencing others, there are many different ways to inspired people. One example that I think is, that they can be moments were you do not need someone to inspired you, you need to think your situation because you are going to try to make it better by the way you think is the right decision for you.

Another example that I think of is, that we are humans and we are going to make mistakes and the people needs to learn from their mistakes, they can be many ways of trying to inspired a person but there times were you do not even think of someone to inspired you.

When people think of a inspiration or a motivation to do something they do not realize that they probably have been though the same situation but everyone is different, things may work for that person but that does not mean that it can benefit you, it should just be to see it as an example and try to make it better for you and get the positive things.

Sometimes it is just an coincidence that they have gone throng the same situation, and they feel identify not necessary inspired, it can also be a way to see how people can have many different ways to handle a situation, like what did I did that that person handle it different than from what I went through if it was the same situation, what can a make different if that situations happens again.

Is that there times that they feel touch by the way there life, or situation is similar to someone who when throng the same situation, it can be inspired by the way that they went throng the same problems, feel identify with something that happened to a friend, a family member, or them self. There are times that just by the action that someone can know, can feel, can think they way they felt in that situation, can be so influence by them, for knowing that you have not been the only one that went though that.

But it can be helpful to have someone that can inspired some one with there experience, sometimes people do not know what else to do they feel like there the only ones that have gone through the same situation, and a inspiration of a person can help them feel that they have someone who has been through that and that if they did it they can do it. It can also just be in there head that they think they need someone as an example just to be better or to feel confident with them self.

There always going to be good or bad moments sometimes you experience something that can make them be that person who inspires, I think it can definitely inspired someones action. A behavior can influence others, but everyone has different ways to think and it is not necessary if they watch someone doing a positive or negative thing will influence them is all in they way they want to act, the kind of person they are and the way they think. But it is a good thing to inspired other and make them look what you have been trough and be a part f a influence that someone can be touch or identify by your life ",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5

ABFEE879153D,"I believe that graduating high school in three years is the best option out there, the reason why i support this statement is because, i myself i'm graduating early the reason why i decided to this was because, i felt like i was too mature for highschool and i felt like i could do more things that highscool will limit me from doing. So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool don't really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we won't even need after high school. Ok let look at it this way, when we take history classes in highschool are kids really going to remember what was George Washington favorite food? or when did the civil war began? yes i know it can be important for us to know our history but we should'nt be taking it for four years non-stop. For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didn't offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he can't do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and it's totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i should'nt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they did'nt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they should'nt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop. I'm very happy to say that i'm class of 2020!! instead of 2021, And i'm very happy that i took that road.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5
10A367BB87EB,"Based on Emerson's statement, I firmly agree that if you never try to do something beyond what you already know, you will never do something and know if you could have done it or of you were good at it. Based on my experience, for what I've live and for what I know, I strongly believe and agree with this statement. My brother for example wanted to be an engineer, with hard work and effort he made it. In the other hand we have Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany.

For example, my brother wanted to be an engineer since he was little, at the time he reach High school, he was sure what career he wanted for his future. He started taking courses that would help him get credits for college and getting involve with sports that would help him get scholarships. Also, he took classes that would help him improve his skills and understanding of his future career. Now with hard work and effort, he graduated as an engineer from Generic_school and he's happily working with his dream job. This shows that with hard work you can accomplish any goal and letting yourself grow.

Another example was Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany. At a young age Hitler had a dream, he wanted to study arts, he started working on it, but when he apply to college he wasn't accepted. That was the moment when Hitler decided to do something different, and experience something new that could change his life. With hard work and patience he did it. Even though he fail the first time, he didn't give up, therefore, he became a dictator.

Some people say that you should do what life gives you at the moment because even if you work hard, sometimes you don't reach what you were hoping for and the work is not even worth it, however, you should always try to do something to grow because if you don't, that's when life gets too bored, you don't have to be in the same spot your entire life. You need to let yourself expand and fly to grow and experience something beyond what you already know, something that will make proud at the end of the day.

In conclusion I agree with Emerson's statement that if you never try yo do something beyond what you already know, you will never grow and never have experience something out of your comfort zone. You'll never know if what you could have done was worth your time, which is why you should always try to something beyond what you have already master and challenge yourself to do bigger things that you never knew you could.

279245CFCCF4,"An Old Proverb Says Honesty Is The Best Policy

I agree about being honest at all times. Because thats how I was taught and even though I get in trouble, when Im honest it's better than lying. Because lying can get you in to worst trouble. If your always honest people can always trust you and who doesn't want to be trusted? My grandma always told me that when you do something bad or lie karma is going to bite you hard. But, sometimes your going to have to lie for an important reason like hurting someones feelings, I think its a horrible feeling to hurt someones feelings am I right?

However when your honest people will always respect you, like you, and honer you. For an example this has happened to me if your at school and your at lunch and everyone is supposed to be quiet and you and your friend start talking, a teacher calls both of you over and she said,""were you guys talking"" my friend said no and I said yes I was talking , and the teacher said, ""thank you for being honest you can go back and finish your lunch"" but, my friend got in trouble.

My first reason why we should have more time at5 school is getting work done. If theres more time at school,then theres more time to do your homework at school. Getting your homework done so you dont have to do ot at home because you finish your work at school. My reason is getting work done.

My second reason why we should have more time at school is your friends. School can get boring so thats why you have friends so you can hangout with them at school. Your friends can be your work buddy so you and your friends can work together at school so you can finish your work. You can have fun with your friends at school so it wont be so boring i school. My other reason is your friends.

My third reason why we should have more time at school is your grades. Is your grades bad? Well you can make it up because theres more time at school. If you have more work and if you get a good grade on it,the your grade will go up. Theres more time at school so you can make up work that you did bad on because theres more time at school.

I think for be enthusiasm I have success for this reason I'm agree the success consist in no be scary to loss and alway be enthusiasm.

Also many peoples said that the success not consist in be enthusiasm because they said manytimes the peoples that are enthusiasm like for example, when they will stard a business or differents type of jobs they loss money for example or also they always fail in everything and the reason is because they are very enthusiasm for this rasson they said that be enthusiasm not always is good and also not a;ways consist in the success.

but is a opinion because there are many people that are agree and other are desagree because some people take a good opportunities because they said that they was very entusiasm and also there are people that never know what is success for this reason are desagree but in my situation

I just want to start this letter by telling you a little bit more about my interest towards your company . As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage .

Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers.

For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company

For example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc.

If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do.

I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers. I believe I can apport a lot to this company.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5

I am very honored to write to you this letter and i pray you take time from your busy schedule and read this this letter .

i hope you are doing good as i am here.

i also want to say that i am happy to be a student in your school.

first of all i take a stand on your decision of changing the school food to a very healthier one and say it a very good one.

it's a very thoughtful idea , and it's also shows that you love the school and i appreciate you for such a great idea. it's a good idea because, half of the student have allergic reaction to some food the chief's cook so they rather go hungry or have an empty stomach and if such incident still goes on, student might even pass out one day.

secondly, if we get healthier food, we will be active and our brains will be able to function well as soon as class start. However, having a good breakfast or even any good food to begin your day sometimes help the brain to work very well , and it's also help make the brain be in a very good position of working during the day.

and not only does it work for the brain, it's also consist or contain some particular minerals like carbohydrate, protein, and fat and other supplementary substance that also help for human growth and also help give energy to the human body.

lastly , changing the school food will also will make student that has never tried the school lunch will now want to try it . Moreover, some student order food and have it deliver to the school all because they do not like the school food or allergic to certain food , and if such incident keeps happening, the school food will go waste and it's will make the school loose money.

so therefore, i will end my speech by saying that it's a very good and and a nice decision for having to change the school food to a healthier one .once again i hope you take time from your busy schedule and read this letter. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

Since i started to be more positive in my life, everything was looking better, i found the job that i wanted, i bought my first car, and, me and my family move to a new house, overall everything was looking better. Based on my experience people should be positive and be around positive people, listen to positive music and found activities that incorporate positive attitude.

People should find new friends that give good vibes and help them become a better person, because sometimes the problem might not be themselves , might be people thats around you telling bad stuff, and always making you a have a bad day.

Changing the music that you listen to, could help you be more positive, because most of the songs and artists that most people listen to these days, sign about, drugs, killing people, gang related stuff, and thats good if you want to be positive.

Founding activities that incorporate positive attitude could help also, like going to church, going to the movies with the family, or going to a motivational speeches, will get you into a positive mood and forget about all those negative stuff going on in your life.

In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.

My first reason that support my response, is that if you don't keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they don't try their best.

My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself.

My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.

To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

A lesson i would teach to elementary students is about being active in life and why its's important to be active in life and it's,doing sports or or a physical activity, eating healthy, and going to the gym.

Doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the excercise you need and loosing weight. It is very important sports if your a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. Kids don't have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. This could be there daily exercise or weekly excersie.

Eating healthy is very important, because you won't have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart diesease. Kids should eat there vegtables too, because it won't make you gain alot of weight. In my opinion I think vegtables are better than fruits. Children need to stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy food, because if you consume those types of foods it causes high blood presure, which gives you headaches. This could benefit for the rest of their lives.

KIds should go to the gym once in a while, because they can go on a tredmill for 10 minutes. Kids should lift dumbells also, becuase it gets them stronger, and they could lift them at any size. Box jumps are perfect for leg strength, and it helps you with your athlecticism and vertical. The gym is perfect for a exercise routine.

To be yourself in a world that os constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

Kids also try to fit in by doing what other people tell them to do, making dumb decisions that could potentially end you up in jail or possibly something even worse effecting their future all because they wanted to fit in.

Peer pressure is a main factor in kids that are trying to fit in. Kids pressure other kids into making poor decisions when in reality they don't wanna do it but they wanna look cool infront of others kids so they do it anyways. In reality it isn't cool to do what people tell you to do especially when it's just to fit in with others.

In my opinion people shouldn't make poor decisions trying to fit in with the others, you should be yourself, it doesnt matter where you from or what type of clothes your wearing everyone should be accepted no matter who they are. Kids should be leaders not followers, you can end up with the wrong friends that could care less about you, but are only with you because you make the poor decisions they're telling you to make.

I think that everyone need take the program, because the students got more time to work, and to learn too, so the program is a big help for the students who take it.

Many people have goals, someone have high goals and others have low goals.

The high goals is so hard finish it, however, we never change a high goal by a low goal only because is more easy.

Although you have one hundred low goals it's impossible say ""one hundred low goals is equal to a high goal"" because a high goal can to become successful and though you'll do one hundred low goals it's almost impossible you become successful.

It's very important have high goals in our life to be a great person, taking high goals you can to detach in anything, however, taking low goals you never can to be successful

To start, it's very important have high goals to be a great person. For example: Keanu Reeves, a susseccfuly actor, is a great person showing the money is not important with his life. some times a high goals no always is have money, also can to be a personal goal.

To next, taking a high goal you can to detach in anything. For example: Kobe Bryan, the bigger player of the NBA, was the best player in basketball because he wanted become the best. You are not the schism, if you work for you like you can to be the best in anything.

To finish, taking low goals you never can to be successful. For example: somebody having low goals never can learn of his mistakes, furthermore, that person never can to grow. but if you want to become successful you need to find anything that to feel passion and going to for that.

the high goals can be hard included impossible to reach, but, we never to give up, only you say yourself ""i can do it"" so you will be in the first step in the success'es path.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0
310CDA45739E,"Imagination is like thinking to do diet and go to gym to get slim. Knowledge is just like running on a treadmil for 2 hours in a weak to get your weight under 79.

I believe that Imagination is more Important than knowledge, because when the writer writes a book, first they Imagine the topic for their book. They don't start to write the book unless they Imagine the topic.

Same as, the writers Imagine what they want to write about, they don't just start to get Information about something, asking their parents what to write, how to write. They Imagine, then they start their work.

However, Imigination is also similar when you think with your sister to convince your mom to get you lots of candy. You don't ask your dad, how to convice mom to get candy. For example, the person who get the idea to Invent phone, frst he Imagine,

what does phone look like, how many buttons should be there, and then he also get help with his knowledge but first he Imagine what does phone look like, how will people buy this, why should they buy my phone.

Also If we use knowledge more than Imagination, the new generation will only use the cell phones to search for their homeworks. They will not Imagine to do homeworks or other things by theirself. They will just copy someone's idea, which is going to demolish their brains. There will be no more good inventions, The people's brain will stop working. Also, people will not do their work because they know they can just copy someone's idea.

For example, If I dont Imagine that when I will be 16, how I am going to get a job. What If I just go to Youtube and search for it, but I will not find anything and I will waste my Important time. Incase if I imagine what kind of job I want to do or where I want to do, I am pretty sure that It will not waste my time. Infact It will give me some ideas for future. In my opinion we should imagine more than using knowledge.

Imagination keeps your brain work and It also keeps you active. If we dont use imagination then how our new Inventors will Introduce their creative inventions. If the stylists doesnot use their imagination then how we are going to wear brautiful clothes. If they use just knowledge and don't use their imagination, I guess they will not get that much success in their buisness. Designers use their minds to help with their clothes design. They imagine the ideas for clothes, so the people will buy more and more clothes from them.

The people who use Imagination more than knowledge live longer. From now I will also use imagination as more as I can. So I will give an opinion to all of you who are reading this use your imagination than knowledge and get success in your work. I don't say that using knowledge is a waste of time, use your knowledge also but not all the time, also use your mind to imagine good, Intresting things.

In conclusion Imagination is more Important than knowledge. So, I will agree with scientist Albert Einstein. I will also force you to think about this. Writers, designers , Inventors all uses their Imagination more than knowledge. Now I will also try to focus on my Imagination more than focusing to copy other's information.

Students might change their minds of playing around in school from visiting this type of job students will see people working hard and fast every single day and getting paid a small amount so students would not want to be working at a place like that in there future so it could pursue them to start putting more effort in school and not to play around in class, and have a successful job.

Some parents don't have money to put their child in school Furthermore there are going to have to work at a hard working job but students don't have to because you have a chance and you got your education so it might teach students to take this advantage to have a success job and not to play around on the other hand teens that don't get their education will work at a place that pay a small amount.

If students don't take their education serious your parents paid the money for your education and if you just don't pay attention and not try the money your parents paid will be a waste because you didn't learn anything cause you goof of and you won't be able to have a successful job so visiting this job will change students thought pf whether they should play around or not so if you take your education serious you can have a job that pays you a lot of money and be successful in life but not doing anything in school won't get you anywhere.

Because they always have their noses in their phones and they never take time to go outside. Very few peoplw know what it's like to actually spend time outside.

Sports are another example, not only are they fun, but they are alsp helping you stay healthy especially if you play almost everyday. If you think about it every sport requires you to run or to keep moving. Sports can also be something you do after dealing with a lot of stress or work. They were shown to be a good for both your body and your mind.

Families also become closer when they spend time together with no sort of technolgy that can distract them. I think now in days families aren't as close as they used to be because we spend to much time on our phones and not so much on the people who care about us.

Technology has advanced a lot in these past years and it is fine that people want to explore new things.

822F6C3B3C03,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson quote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" because yes we may always be doing something but we never really put in mind what we really are going to do.

One way to be able to accomplish things is if you have a goal set. If you set a goal that means you are going to want to achieve it. Prove others that you can do it and that nothing can stop you from doing it. Always give it your best, never think negative because if you think negative then you're never going to accomplish anything in life. Prove to yourself that you can also try new things and that can help you a lot.

Always be confident in yourself no matter what. Always put in mind that you can do whatever you want to do. For example, if you have to mow the lawn but you're in your bedroom laying down looking out the window, the lawn isn't going to mow itself because it needs someone to move it around. Trying new things doesnt hurt at least trying for quite some time and it also benefits you because you're doing something for your own good.

Never use laziness as an excuse to not do anything. If you always say i'm tired then you're never going to do anything, you're just giving up on yourself.

For example, if you hate being home all day doing nothing, then go out go find what you can do because if you try new things you'll end up liking it. If you're an active person you'll accomplish way more than expected because you're going to be moving around and getting out you're comfort zone. Helping others also can be a way in accomplishing more than just sitting there because you're talking to someone or showing someone how to do something. Helping the community in many different ways can also be a good thing but not just for you but the community, because you're going out and helping. Doing and trying new things motivates you to keep doing more.

I strongly do believe that if you're doing something that you put your mind to, then you're always going to accomplish more than expected. If you sit down and say you're going to do something you'll never do it because you're just sitting down. Your words are way different than your actions. To be able to do something you have to get up from the couch and do it without having to think so hard about it.         ",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
C2F34D6A76D4,"""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Although the word failure is the lack of success, is the loss of the ability to work normally. As humans, we all know that sometimes instead of get better in life, we currently loss our capacities to start over and follow what we want for us because as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said ""do not loss the enthusiasm"".

To being, humans fail every time in life, every episode in our life there is always a failure, it is always there for us like if we need it and maybe this is why we always wondered why failure have to happen during the most incredible episode in our life, we always think this is because we did something bad or we did not tried our best as much as we can for get that job, pass that test or even keep all our problems in line, but why failure became a big role into our daily life?.

The reality of failure is not only fail, is to see what we did bad to get better, is to understand that we need to fail, understand that fail is good for us and help us to do not make the same mistakes that we did in the past because every time is a failure it is also an experience and a new lesson to success.

For example, scientists tried many experiments to just get one result and they fail very often but at the end they discovered new things not just only what they were looking for. This shows that not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer and new things to discovered.

Furthermore, stay positive for humans could became a big issue in our community. Every human try everyday to stay positive and see all the mistakes as much positives as we can but this became more stressful after a failure.

What we all need to know is that feel stress, feel insecure of ourselves is good. We all are humans, our feelings make us more stronger than we actually are however, most people could feel depress after a failure and this is why we goes down, we loss our hope and most people stop to keep working in their goals and just get tired and feel depress.

For example, there is a book that the students of Generic_School were reading last year called ""The life of an Indian"". This book is about a poor Indian boy that lives in a reservation, he has no hopes after one day his teacher introduced the Indian to a different world out of the reservation to find hope and believe in himself, follow his dreams instead to keep poor in the reservation. He fail a thousand times, but instead to get back, he goes thought his issues.

This shows that stay positive after our failures even for a poor little boy is not always too hard. Clearly not everyone could do it that way, but we always want our happiness, and to get happiness, failure could became our big right hand.

In conclusion, join from our mistakes is the best way to be successful, to be better in life, to keep in mind that every failure is a new experience and a new lesson. Not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer.

I am completely agree with Winston Churchill, feel enthusiasm for what go next in our life is more excited than we all think and as humans, if we start to believe in ourselves and stay positive and start to dream and also understand that failure is part of our daily, we will become more successful with the knowledge to how life really works and that life is not too hard as we all been thinking.

Doing more than what your good at helps grow your confidence, and your way of doing things for the better. Doing more could possibly give you a little higher pay raise or be a boss at a at a big company.

Doing more than what your already good at can go a long way for you.

You should start doing better right now because it will benefit you in so many ways.

Not doing more than you can already do can possibly give you bad rep. Or some people will see you as a lazy person in life. Because that person is not pushing him or her self to do more or the beyond because that person isnt motivated to do anything more that their good at. That person wont succeed as much as the person that is doing more or the beyond.

One time when i was a small Child. My Uncle always talked to me about a lot of stuff.

The most important thing he told me is to do more than what i can already do. Because it will take me places and it will make my life a lot better. He said if you do more. I will succeed more in life. When i got older he talked to me more about it. Because he knew i was gonna do more in life. Now i work as hard and beyond than the other person. And make more money because i work more than i already mastered.

70E490A83717,"To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer.

Deligence leads us to a road of success. For example, The successful people are always willing to spend times and put efforts in their work. In history, a lot of leaders showed us that success comes from keeping doing and trying things over and over to make it what it is today.

When we become deligent, we spend our time doing meaningful things. We become more efficient and tend to be more responsible for our lifes, it pushes us forward to our destinations in a good way.

Experiencing lets us learn more. For example, We learn from books and documentaries about what other people have experienced or doing different things by ourselves then gain perspectives from it. Those things make us talented and gives us guides about how things might be when we grow up. It also gives us advantages when we encounter difficult things and try to deal with it. The more we experience, the more valuable and proficent we will be.

While some people believe that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. Other argue that inactivity also serve a purpose, for example, They say that we only live once, why give ourselves such hardtimes and do not do things that make us feel comfortable and happy.

Most of the parents, students, and the teachers like to see students graduate early in high school, and this programs are mostly in the U.S.A. Student who graduated early will have a lot of opportunity to finish school and have a better life, most summer school lesson can also help students to take less classes at school. It is a good idea for student to take only three classes in high school in order to graduate and go to college, back those days my mom use to tell me a story, about the opportunities we have in we that most people don't really care about. She used to tell me a story about her in high school, how hard it is to graduate, most people can take five to six years in order to graduate and go to college. And most people did- en make it to college, cause they don't have the money to pay and it really hard to find a job in Africa. Student drop out of school just because they don't have the opportunity we have right now to graduate in high school. Most people will say it like this, ""Genius without education is like silver and mine"". People are brave, strong, smart, last learning, and well educated but they just don't use it and decided to let it go. This mostly happened to people who have the opportunity to do the right things but decided to let it go, and my gran mother use to tell me a story.

first reason, the three years of high school helps student to graduate early and move on to the next level, helps student to finish school early and have a better life.

Second reason, helps students learn faster and makes it easier for college, it also helps student to take less classes in high school.

B067F0CBE15C,"Having students take courses during the summer to graduate in three years isn't a great idea. The reason why I think it isn't a great idea is, students might need more credit to graduate, some students have jobs during the summer and could feel stressed workng and going to school at the same time, and students like to take a year break off school.

First reason why I think it isn't a good idea is because, students might need more credit and need to take more classes. if they where to want to do it but didn't have enough credit they would have to double up there classes and doing that, can make them feel stresssed and pressured. Three years of high school isn't enough, in four years a student can join a club, play a sport and have regular classes and not feel over whelmed, and doing all that can make he/she look good when looking at what college to go to. But if a student wanted to do all that while having way to much classses could make them feel over whelmed.

Second reason why, students have jobs when they start high school. We all people like to have money in are pockets and students get there money by working during the summer. But how can a student have a job and go to school, it gives less time for the student to do his hobi which is working. In the summer a student wants to work to save up for a car or for college, it's the only time a student doesn't have to worry about school, they could just be focusing on saving up to go to a good college.

Last but not least, at the end of the school year students like to go ahead and go to college but some might want a break to make money or think about what they want to do or just want a break of school. Having a break gives you time to work full time somewhere and save up for something you need like, a car, a house, or money for colllege. It takes time for you to be successful in life which is why you should take things slow and not make yourself stressed and tired doing everything fast.

In conclusion, students who graduate in three years instead of four years, isn't a great idea. Students might need more credit to graduate, some might have jobs during the summer and if they where to take classes they could feel stressed, and some students like to take a year break from school and would want to be working making money for them to buy needs.

F88A0801C9EB,"In my opinion it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. If you're committed to anything you will always want to achieve that certain goal. Having a career you are committed to at a young age has many positive outcomes. One of the outcomes is you can find a career much faster. Another positive outcome is having a goal that you want to achieve. The final positive outcome is having more time in high school to do other activities. Having a certain career you want to achieve at a young age will make you improve on lots of things.

You will find a career much faster if you're committed to one specific career at a young age. If you are focused on that certain career you will be doing things that you need to achieve to have that certain career you have been planning at a young age. For example when you are committed to that one certain career you will be taking specific classes. Finally when you sign up for that career or try out for that career you will most likely get accepted since you will have experience. Having experience on a career will help you so much when applying for a career. People will most likely see that you have experience and want to hire you. That is why it is better having a career you are committed to at a young age.

If you have a goal you want to achieve at a young age you will do anything to achieve that goal you since you're committed to achieve that goal. It is also just like being committed to a certain career at a young age. For example in order to achieve a goal you will need to do anything it takes to achieve it. As in a career you need to study as much as you can of the career and take classes that will help you achieve the career you are interested in. If you have a goal you will most likely achieve the goal if you try and never give up. If you give up on the goal you will not succeed. Just like in a career you are committed to at a young age. If you give up on the career you will most likely need to find another career and learn new things and start all over. That is why you should have a career already planned at a young age so you won't give up later on and need to start all over.

You will have more time in high school to do more activities if you are committed to a certain career at a young age. For example in high school their are many sports , clubs , and other after school activities you can do or tryout for. If you already have a certain career in mind since you were little and young you can have more time to do sports and other activities that can also help achieve that certain career you are interested in. Also it is good having more time to do other things instead of still not knowing what career you want and having to speak to counselors , teachers , and searching up careers you are interested in doing. If you already planned your career when you were young you won't have to worry about having to look for a career and having to stress out. Some students stress out if they don't have a career in mind and not knowing what career they want to do. Having more time to yourself and not needing to worry about finding careers is much better than looking for careers and needing to take new classes to have that certain career that you are just planning to have. That is why it is better to be committed to a career at a young age.

Overall having a career to be committed to at a young age is better than not having any career planned out for the future. You will get the career quicker than usual. You will have an achievement you will want to accomplish. You will have a better schedule to do and focus on other things. This will improve lots of your characteristics and improve you as a person. It will show you how committed you are and how you can get anything done. When you get the career youve been committed to since you were young you will be proud of yourself since you have been committed and focus on that career like all your life.

57A750437C3A,"Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greastest accomplishment"" I agree because if you do everything by yourself better things happens. Like how he saids be yourself can make you better by trying new things, so many reasons to be your own.

First of all, to be yourself can make you great life or more better can open new opportunities, by saying this a refer to get ideology with a great future. A example, making yourself with rules or putting time for something you want to do can be awesome way to start, someone told me if you fight for dreams and you really want to do it, you will get it by doing yourself. Then you can be proud of yourself by doing something the you never imaginate to do it.

Second of all, when you get staff done by your own can be a great example for so many kids in this world. Believe or not be an example for someone is the most accomplisment beacuase they want to do or be like you. Also by trying everyday something new can make you better. How this quote says "" Hard work beat talents when talents doesn't work hard"". Something useful is everyone learn new things by mistakes. Make mistakes is not a big problem, making a mistake means the you are trying to do it better and be better by learning how do it.

Third of all, the last but not least frienships have a lot with this, one question very important in here is How can I be sure the my friends are real?. Yes, probably that can be a problem that's why be yourself is the greastest accomplishment because friends can take you down with drugs, alcohol and bads things. That's doesn't mean the you can not have friends. That means you have to choose really well your friends because hypocristy exist maybe they want you down without future and great life. Hypocristy is the most danger thing in the world by hypocristy you can make people think about how they want to be or what they want to do.

In conclusion, doing yourself can make you better and open opportunites the you never imaginate. Try to do something the you love or like that's a good way to start to be yourself. Choosing what's good for you or what not and remember always fight for your dreams. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
EC0B04508F7C,"WORKING IN GROUP

Why the most students like working in group and not alone? the most students prefer working with friends, because in schools the works or homework require more the one students ,but .Some people said of working alone is more benefits for the students. I believe of working in group you can make friends, helping together, and have more time for you work.

The first reason,

if working in group you can make friends because you need talk about the work,

sometime the students speak their experience or opinions about the work,but when the students is not the same country, and the works talk about the country or religious is good because. The students have different opinion and sometime you make friends when you with other students have the same opinion, and when working in group you and your friends have time for talk.

In second reason helping together, because you can ask if you work is good or opinions about the work and look of more information. You can help for materials if you friend not have, and helping together if you consider the work is good or not or change sometime or have or ideas you can tell.

The third reason you have more time for you work if you working in group. Because sometime the teachers not give much day for you work ,and the work is hard, and require much information you can divide the work with you friend . The finally check the information, and put together or you can decide what part you wants working or what parts you can create.

In conclusion is more essay for you if working in group because you can make friends , you can helping together, and you have more time for you work.",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
ED06CD30103F,"Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Life doesn't for that way. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
9F7E189A2DCF,"Do you believe to know a person through one impression? Some people believe that most of the people's personality will depends on their presentation or the way that dress up, they think that your knowledge or your personality is base on how you look. I believe that the first Impression could change for the following three reasons; Your clothes or how you look do not show your type of personality, the kind of person who you are will depends on knowing the person and through knowing the person your idea about the person could change.

The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are.

Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships that's why I believe that who you are will depends on knowing the what kind of person you are.

Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person and they found a good kind of person.

To conclude the first impression is good way to present ourselves but through knowing the person we will find that the first impression does not care when knew the kind of person that's why I believe that first impression could change through knowing that person.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
AE0DB193F5B5,"Today, in the actuality, a lot of people have a big dreams that we can to complete have a better life for our future family or also to own self but a many people be surrender becuase most of the time have the fuilures, when they are doing something; I think that our life without the fuilures will be bored and easy becuase we don't have the energies to work hard or fight for our goals or dreams. I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because you can help other to complete their dreams or their goals, also you can have more spirit and a positives attitudes than you have in the begging, also you can be a successful and strong person.

You can help others to complete with their dreams or their goals, because sometimes a lot of people who want to comply their dreams or goals they don't have the motivation of their families or the economy necessary to buy all the studies or all the things that they need, so when you finish all the goals that you make you, you can assist to others. I know an experience of child from Mexico, his name was Generic_Name. Generic_Name was a child with the low economy resources, I remember that he toll us all the things that he was comply to get a better life for his family and him self. So one day, Generic_Name received a big notice from a presidency of Generic_City, the place were we live, that he can have a opportunity to study whatever he want. He and his family were happy for the big opportunity that Generic_Name have. At pass of the years, when Generic_Name finished study the collage, I know that Generic_Name is a big entrepreneur from a big company that he created after finished the college. Today, also Generic_Name likes help other people who want to be a successful in their life like the presidency help him. In my observation to be a good person likes Generic_Name makes that you have a lot of open opportunities to get the success or the things that Generic_Name every day was dreamed.

Also you can be a successful and strong person because all people knows that the life is not easy and less if you want to do something hard or something that you need put a lot of time in it to pursuit of success and if you think that your goals or dreams are difficult to complete. Sometimes we need strive more that the people or your mind think. Another of my experiences is when was in Mexico, I was little girl, I remember that most of my days I talked with my family, my mother, my father and also sometimes with my grandfathers; about that I want study the High School in Untied States because I saw a TV Shows and movies shows all the schools and also my father lived a lot of years in this country so, he talk me about the schools, the teachers, the classmates, the classes and classrooms that were to different form my country, the lunch time and I think that the thing that was more exercise was with the lockers because in my country don't have lockers or something to put our things likes books, pencils, notebooks and sometimes, the food. At the time that was grow up, I was continue with the same mentality to come to this country to comply my studies. I remember that have a lot of failures in the time to the arrival to United States but,even if never let that my thoughts or the commentaries of the negative people will be fell bad about my big dream. I think that was a strong person because is hard to come to other place with different culture and customers in everything and also is hard and sad separate to the persons who love.

Other might say that the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success does not matter or they are disagree because you can lose your forces to continue and accomplish your goals and sometimes this failure can make us fell sad. However, you can have more spirit and positives attitudes than you have in the begging because when you have a failure in something that you study a lot or put your all time in it, you can have the mentality that you can to do well it, just you need strive a little be more that you make before. This is one of my experiences in my life; the last week, in my History class with Generic_Name, we have a quiz form the first unit so, we did the quiz, but the majority of my classmates and me, we don't pass the quiz, my teacher talked with us to give us a another opportunity to pass it. A lot of my classmates tell her that they do not were think that they can pass it even though they study a lot before the retake but, I have the spirit and the positives attitudes that I can passed the quiz with a good grade and study well at home. I think that my experience, it is good example because a lot of people who want to complete their dreams does not matter the times that they need to try to get a good result and a good recompense for the effort that they make.

In my opinion, I think that Churchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" it is important and I agree with it because you can motive other people to be a good person with good feelings and goals, another reason is because you can to be a successful and respectful person and you can have a good attitudes through haved a bad results, every time you need stay be happy.

D80B98C274D4,"Extending each school day

I totally disagree with extending each school day, because kids wouldn't have enough time do other activities, kids need a distracion away from school, they need to put their minds in something other than just school. Kids, parents, and teacher have other things to do, they all have plans and will get in the way of that.

One of the reasons why i disagree with extanding the school day is that kids will not have enough time to do other activities, for example after school programs, clubs, and practice. If the school board adds another hour kids will get so caught up on homework that will not have enough time to other activities

Kids need a distraction from school, although school is really important, kids needs to distract their minds away from everything in school, like test, wetheater or not they failing, drama, all the stress schools brings sometimes. They just a rest from everything, they need a ""stress free"" time. Kids needs time for themselfs, time to do something that's not always school.

Kids, parents, and teachers do other acitivites after school, for example kids go to football practice right after school or pian lessons, they might not be able to go. They can have doctors appointment,

since some kids get appointments late in day so they won't miss a day in school. Parents needs to go places with their kids at a specifc time, and if they come late and kids will be too tired to go with them. Teachers got palns, they need to do stuff after school, maybe their kids has a game, or they need to go to their kids rehersal and if school board extends a day, teacher would not be able to go because they are working, maybe some teachers studies after work, or they do homework if they in collage. Adding one more hour to school can ruin everyone's schudule.

In conclusion extending each school day can be a big change with time for everyone. Kids needs time for themself, they need distraction away from school and the time it's left for them to have a free time it might be nothing since they will be in school and then do homwork. Everything doesn't always have to be just about school. ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

In my mind I agree with "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" this is very important thing that we might think about, The reason why I agree whit this statement be cause of failure brings me a improvement, success.

I always improve myslef when I get a failure. Last year, I was in high school in New York, it was my first year for studying in America. because it was my first time so I fail a tasting so many tests, I could not talked to any friends and I also could not made friends. everything were so hard for me to pass or event talking whit someone, so I keep continued stady more English skill.

Failure make me stronger and bring me success. I got a lot of problems last year, so

I was thinking about go back to Thailand but I always tell myself ""don't give up Generic_Name,you can try it again, you can do it, you will get it"" and I believe myself. I did not go back to Thailand and I got a lot of new things make myself stronger.

DE54A8F9C29C,"Should students be required to take a class in the arts and should those classes even be a elective? I believe students should have a choose in what they take while in school. Most students when they are not interested in something will most likely not do good in that subject. If you put students in those classes when they dont want to take then the pass rate may drop in those classes. The music, drama, and art class should stay as electives for students that enjoy those classes. I do see how those classes can help a students with some aspects on life but if they dont want to be in that elective then they wont be as involved as everyone else. School is meant for learning and not just putting students in a class they dont like, it's not a good way to teach students. If the student have a choose in what they take, then will students find it interesting and will want to learn more. The classes students choose to take should help them get ready for there future career. I am opposed to having classes in the arts as a required class but I do believe they should stay as electives.

Since I am still a student myself, I know what it is like to be put in a class that I do not finding interesting. I do not feel as if the school should have the right to choose our required electives. Student should have a choose in what class they want because it appeals to them and it's something they actually want to take. If a student choose that class they then choose it for a reason. Thats why if a student gets something they dont like, they are no going to be as engaged in that class and not learn that much as well. A student should have a right not to take the classes in the arts and schools should not make it a required class neither. If school makes those classes required then the pass rate is going to drop and students will not want to attend school as much because they are failing a class they don't even like.

The schools should keep those classes as electives and not as core classes. There are plenty of students that enjoy taking those classes and that do really good in them as well. The classes in the arts are great classes to have a option to take while in school, it opens so many doors for students that want to make a career out of those classes. I'm sure some students learn a lot of life lessons while taking those classes and has helped them in some way. I believe you can learn a lot of skills in those classes as long as your engaged in them and actually like the classes. School should keep music, drama, and art class as electives so the people that want to take it can.

The classes students take should help them in there future career. If a student want to take a class that he want to work in as a career, they shouldn't be rejected to take it because the classes in the arts are required to take.

For example, if a student whats to become a construction work, then I do not see how taking a music class is going to help that student reach his goal to be in that career. The things students do now while in school can change there lives just by simply making them take a class they dont like. There are a wide range of classes students can take that will better prepare for when they leave school. The classes students take now will help them but if schools make the students take something they dont want to take then will it possible ruin them. Thats why students shouldn not be required to take the classes in the arts and choose in what they want to take.

I don't believe schools should me the classes of the arts so be required to take. But I do believe they should stay as electives in the school. Students should be able to choose what they take in school and they should take something that is appealing to them. The classes to have benefits to some of the students and is a great elective class to have. The students should be able to pick a class that is going to help them in there future career and also get a aspect in what they are getting into.

My first reasons:student should not do there classes from home.

Because it can be hard doing you work at home it batter do the work at work because you can get help by the teacher at home no one can help you. It can be hard to do the work from online because you don't know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home.

My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home.

Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business person and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did.

my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids.

Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online only for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid.

My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home.

I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home.

summer:

Collage should have online classes becuase it will easy for them do complete the classes online at home they will have time to do it and get a batter garde so you can complete the classes and take a new classes when you get A or B.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5
D159EE3218BC,"Showing kindness to others is very important because people see you that you have a kind soul, people can spread kindness around the world, and kindness will help you throughout your future. Kindness is the key for success and enjoying your life. The world would not been the same if their were not any kindness, imagine what it would be like if no one knew what kindness is. Having kindness in your blood could change your future to an even better one. Having no kindness means that you are negative and misrable but all that could change when a person shows you how kindness could change your personality.

When people see you showing kindness, that shows that you have a good heart and a good soul. And, it also shows that you care and very nice so, people could trust you. Thinking kindness is very positive and relaxing because it is a very good thing to do in life. Kindness will never be a bad thing because it is meant to change the future. No matter what, kindness could never go wrong as long as you try it to others.

Spreading kindness around the world could change how people think, in terms of doing something bad is not part of kindness. Therefore, giving kindness to a person could spread around the world, and you would not even know that all this kindness was because of you. Without kindness, all the virture words would not even exsist. There would be no such things as being caring, loving, sharing, humble, and so much more. Every small kindness you show to others, will change their emotion and follow your action as they did to you.

Kindness will really help you in the future because it shows you who you truly are. If you show kindness everywhere then their could be a chance for you to get into jobs easily or, for you to get good grades on your school work. Also, in the future you would be very grateful that kindness brought you here into this amazing life, and all the kindness you have done in your previous years. Kindness is always by your side. You will appreciate having kindness in your life because it helps you to become a better person.

Kindness will not randomly appear to you, you just need to make and share kindness. Life is waiting patiently for the people to spread kindness everywhere but, unfortunatly some people would not let that happen. In our expectation people should already have kindness for, in reality thousands of people do not want to share their kindness. Some people are trying to spread kindness because they want the world to be a good place for the future. Finally, kindness will always be their in your heart, you just have to let it out.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
3D8CF58944E1,"I think schools shouldn't add one and a half hours more to schools because kids need time to rest there brains, have enough time to make it on time to there after school activities, and students need more time to finish up their homework and studying.

First, kids need time to rest there brains by going outside, and watching on the TV for a little.

If schools add more time, then students will not have any time to have fun which causes them to not have much time to sleep, less time to sleep effects their school day. An example of that is if I had extra time to my school then I would have had no time to play, take a nap, or watch youtube. That causes me to not have enough sleep time. This type of rule is not healthy for the students.

Second, kids need time to make it to there after school activities. after school activities are usually straight after school, but if students add more time to school then kids will not make it to his or her after school activity. An example is if a student had to go to football practice everyday at 4:00, then students would not make it if school ended at 4:15. without physical education and only just education by sitting in a chair just writing and reading is not healthy for your body. that's why students need more time for there after school activities. this is also bad because it effects your sleep time also which makes you tired for school the next day.

Last, students will not have enough time to finish up there homework from all the time from school and other stuff they have to do at home. For an example is if there was a test the next day, and I havn't studied so I had to study, I wouldn't have had enough time to study because the extra time in school or if I had to do an after school activity. This is not good for students to add time to school so they do not have enough time to study or finish homework because they will not get a good grade on the test or quiz and especially get a bad grade in the class.

Back to the thesis, they should not add an hour and a half of school because it will effect our brain, body, and grades. It will affect it by being late or not showing up to his or her after school activity, less time for the kids brain to rest, and not having time to finish homework or to study.

Why would people want to add time to school?",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
9EAB766AF4BE,"Students and teachers have important roles in their life. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. If they need it because they can loose their job.

Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.

Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. They will know what kind of project to create. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.

At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5

All the students should perform community service because the adults are out there working the whole day and when they come back home they want to drive on a clean community. The students when they do community service they are learning about their future life it is like a job you can't slack off. The adults don't have enough time to do community work with their job and all that but who has more free time than the students or kids . That is not all when we clean up our community our children our going to live in a clean community so help make a better future. The students may this is corny but they know too that they want their children to in a clean community and for their grandchildren. The community service could be any not just cleaning up also help tutor your neighbors child with home work and any thing out side your house helping is community service. You can babysit your neighbors kids and other peoples kids too that could count as community. The teachers could have like a game where who ever does the most community service gets like a prize of the class.

CF288DDE1328,"Most student enjoy summer vacations, but some educators believe that summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily. Educators argue that there should be a year-around school, where there would be a 3-4 week off in the spring and fall. But as a student, my position is the opposite of what some educators believe. If our summer keeps as all this past years we can do so many things. When our summer vacations arrive is when all students fell free and out of pression of passing the course year. Summer vacations also open different doors in our life, students chooises are vacations and traveling, others prefer to work, gain money and experience for our future. If summer vacations will be shorter not many students could handdle school, beaks in summer, longer winter break and summer would not have the same impact as summer vactions. It can sound exagerate but that wouldn't be much time to us for do our sumer change.

First of all, In my own experience I like when summer is coming because I know that new experience are waiting for me, but also I like summer vacations because all the ""suffer"" of final examns and the S.O.L are over once again, and I think passing your goals during the years always deserves and award, in this case, Summer vacations. What educators don't see about summer is that gives us an opportnity to be more responsable; many students like me decide to start working. Working has made me a more responsable man, has teach me how reality is, and that money is not an easy thing, and the easier way I can make money is study. Summer is one of the greates time for students, many students go to new places, to visit old family menbers and pass time whit them. Summer last year gived me the chance to go back to my countrie, I couln't do it during winter or spring because I have to study, and the time educators think is the best for us would't provide the same amount of aventures.

More over, When winter break is coming we all happy but it feels too short, adding a few days wouldn't make it so different, plus your adding the same amount of days in four seasons, time for us will pass flying. I also think that many of us would fell like school is never going to end, I would be so stress out that my preformence during the school could be decreasing more and more. Last time I looked an article were they showed a chart, out of 100 student 80 said that they prefere summer vacations over having longers breaks during the year. After that they made an experiment, during a year they sow how was the performence in the students who's choices was summer vacation, and it got prooved that they were doing better because they were constanly going to school.

On the other hand, educators are not at all wrong, when I start againg the school year I some times don't remenber thing that I sow the year before. Also having so much vacations makes me miss school, been with my friends and learning new things. Educators may have a diferet opinion than I, and they can be the one's who are correct, they said that summer is too long because of their experience, and maybe they had learn less. Educators are people who know more than students because of their understanding in the power of learnig.

In conclusion, summer vacations is the best, and it never has to change the aumount of days that they give to us, is prefectly the days that we all need to refresh from school and things that happened over the year.

Summer bring us new experience and it teachs us things like reponsability, a very importat human thing that we all has to have. I beliebe that we things shouldn't change, people and cientificts had prooved that the best way of lerning is how we do it.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
11DD0B26B584,"Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time they're working.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.

Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.

In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.

In conclusion,schools should provide classes online because colleges,universities also provide them and most of the people who have taken them have been successful from their classes. That is the best thing schools could do for the students.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0

35E552843ADF,"Teachers and students volunteer to meet with those who have difficulty in certain subjects. By having a afterschool homework club. Reasons for a afterschool homework club? An afterschool homework club would be nice to have because they get better grades, they could study more, and they could understand the subject better

First of all, they get better grades by helping each other on their homework and they can socialize to know more people, make new friends. Plus they can make up stuff they haven't done at all and have a zero in their grade. It also benefits in all ways, you could get straight As by just taking 1-3 hours extra hours of your day and putting the work into it. If you don't work at all you could consider trying harder to pass the class.

Next, they could study more. Studying more could be a benefit because better test grades, better quiz grades, etc. Also they could get ahead on their classes by doing extra homework and normal work. If you never study you could start by considering to join this club. It could be loads of fun if you make it fun.

Therefore, they could understand the subject better by getting someone to help them. Doing loads of extra work to get your grade up and understand it better. They could help each other out and could achieve their goal of getting to understand the difficult subject.

Finally, those are the reasons why the idea would be a benefits for everyone. It could help everyone out in every way. Thats why I consider this idea to be true and make the club available for everyone. Also theres a ton more benefits that could help too.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0
77D5466305CB,"Have you ever wonder what would happen if you know more about something you like, something you want to experience, how people can do many things, how they learn how to do a lot of things. Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person.

Trying new things is like an adventure. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do. My oldest sister know how to make cakes, she thought that was all she can do, but one time I dare her to do a recipe that is famous in my country, ""pupusas"" she didn't know how to make it, but she try, she fail and what she cook was really bad, but she started to practice and try until she reach it. Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know.

People learn more things. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake. When I came here I thought I wouldn't learn english and that I wouldn't have friends, but then I thought ""If I don't start practicing or trying to learn I won't be able to communicate with others"" so I start trying and know I speak a little bit more and understand a little bit more. Then I thought ""I need to speak with other so I can practice more"" but I was so scared that people wouldn't understand me but I had to try, and then I start trying to talk with others, now I am not afraid of talk with others enymore, my english is growing and my experiences too. I would be stuck if I hadn't try.

My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didn't know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesn't know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doens't mean that's all she can do.

Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didn't know that they could do. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesn't mean you can't do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doens't mean it didn't work, it mean something went bad and you don't need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do.

DBC8CBF56BB9,"As a child, I always loved to go to the park. It was my favorite thing to do because I loved playing games with my sisters and sometimes we'd even make up our own game to play. However, things have changed in the past few years and now I barely ever go to the park. The park isn't the same fun and cool place that it used to be anymore, but why?, Why did it change so quickly?.

There are so many reasons to why the park hasn't been visited as much as before, but, yet again only one reason explains why most people barely ever go to the park. The reason for why people never to go the park now is because they don't know what to do at the park anymore. People think that the park is a boring and useless place, but the park have many purposes. People now spend more time on their couch and on their phone and it's very unhealthy and concerning especially when it comes to health issues in the future. The park is a fun and entertaining place to be because there are millions of activities that you could do at the park that are very enjoyable. I'm going to list a wide variety of fun and entertaining activities.

First off, you could always go the park with friends and/or family members. It's always great to be around the people you enjoy the most, especially in a beautiful environment like the park, where everyone could enjoy themselves. Second, you could always head to the park for some quick exercise. You could run, jog, do yoga and much more when you're at the park. It's always a good idea to clear your mind and go for a run at the park when it's beautiful outside. It's always important to make sure your health is in good condition and you can make sure that happens by taking a walk at the park. The third activity is, play some fun games at the park!. When your at the park you could always play some fun games that get you pumped up and happy. With the nice, fresh, open space that is available, the possibilities are endless!. You could make up your own fun games with your friends or family members. Now my fourth fun activity is, throwing a fun party!. It could be a birthday, graduation or even a going-away party, The occasion doesn't matter at all!. Having a nice party at the park is one of the funnest things!. You could do a barbecue and play with your friends and/or family members. celebrating outdoors is a great way to have a blast. My fifth activity is, help clean the park. This activity might sound really boring but helping our your community is 100% worth all of your time. When helping out your community you're not only helping those around you but you're helping yourself, the environment and the animals. Many animals live in parks, for example. a squirrel , birds, worms and even small insects. So next time you go to the park, or are planning to go, make sure you at least pick up one piece of trash, because that small piece of trash could save the animals and the environment.

Now my last but certainly not least reason is, grab a book and head to the park and read. This might seem like boring stacked on top of boring but doing this helps you clam down and relax a lot. When you're in a beautiful and peaceful environment, how could you be mad?.

Why should you try one of these activities?. These activities aren't only fun but they do help you in the long run. Hanging out with your friends and family members help you appreciate the people in your lives but also the environment that it giving access to being able to be around people. Taking a nice run at the park helps you by being healthy and improving your well being. Exercising doesn't have to mean running and jogging, it could be yoga too. Making up your own games help you build up your mind especially when you have access to so much space, you can pretty much create a fun and entertaining game. Reading a book is one of the most important things that you have to do in order to build up a stronger brain and doing to it in a peaceful, quite and beautiful environment makes the experience 100x more pleasing. You don't have to choose one of my ideas, you can choose and make up your own activities!. So next time you go to your local park, make sure you contribute and acknowledge the beauty of your community and make sure it's being properly taken care of.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

In this paper i will argue that if students should take class that that will guide them towards a specific career. should student consider their career pass at a young age,yes because when the student gets older and becomes a adult he or she wont have to have a boring and low paying job.

Im am in the eleventh grade and I already know that i want to be when in older, I want to be a U.S.M solder.

The class that am taking right now in high school that will help me become what I want to be when am older is JROTC.

You may ask that is JROTC?

JROTC is a class that teaches student about the United State Armed Forces.

Another class that am taking in my school that will help me with my fucher career is Econ and Finals.

Econ and Finals is a class that is a high school requirement to graduate, but i like that class because i know that its going to help me with my fucher career.

Students could be benefited if they attend classes by coming to school so that they can be attentive in class and will be able to clear their doubts.

Students will not be benefited if they attend classes from home by online or video conferencing because then they will not concentrate much on studies and which will lead to bad grades. They will not be having test and quizzes often. They might become lazy and start copying each other work. If they do not attend school, then there will be less chances of students doing work sincerely at home. They will not be able to get proper education at home and there will be less communication with students and teachers. If there will be less communication then they will not be able to get more open with others. There will be no group work so that students can share their ideas regarding studies. They might start taking breaks often. There will be no routine for students for studying at home. They will not be able to concentrate much working at home due to lot of distractions like T.V, movies, videos games, text ting etc. If you will not get a better education you might not be able to sussed in life. The more you have the education then there are more chances of getting a bright future. The proper education you can get is by going to school. If you will attend school, then you can correct your mistakes and learn from them. If you will stay at home you won't know what are you doing correct and what you are doing wrong.

How much you learn and read more the better because learning and reading takes you around the world. Teachers should also watch every student more carefully because if a student is doing something wrong then teachers can help them and make sure they go in the correct way. Parents should also keep an eye on their student that how they are doing because if they are not then parents can also guide them.

99ECAD55ABD3,"I think it's great for the older students to work with the younger student, because some young students haven't learned about what the older students learned, being a helper to younger ones especially in a school can be an amazing thing to do for example

They can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolers

They can teach how to welcome people

It also helps them to have a great future

The Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students. It can also be a great hobbies for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example

Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor

Help an old person cross the road

Teach kids how to write neatly

This kind of program could help the environment so much. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example

United Kingdom

Norway

Sweden

Denmark

Canada

And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives. It can help so much for others and it teaches respect and that's why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future and they can also help their families and other families.

E6CF2D3B4FA2,"Examples are what makes a readers/audiences be able to get attracted with what the reason the writer is talking about. Since I have used examples in many things things in my life, I personally think that they could help you with a topic that other people are trying to talking about. And since the question is basically asking if ""examples are good to influences people that are trying to do something or does examples are useless and are not really helpful at all?"" I said that Examples are good to influence other people. And here are the reasons why it is a good influential if you are striving for a long- term goal.

Not many reasons are able to support what you are trying to basically explain or prove. What made me think of this is because if you put a reason that isn't strong enough to even support what you are saying, then basically a reason isn't strong enough if you are trying to influence someone. Like for example, if the topic says that anyone can become famous and the reason is ""work hard and never give up."" that really isn't strong enough to influences someone that actually wants to become that type of guy. But if you put a real life example like ""this person name Generic_Name that was a low-class, lives in a 1 bedroom apartment, and makes not a lot of money. And he heard that he can become a rich person. So he was working hard and he saved up on investment. And somehow he actually became the person that he wanted to be."" that is a example that could be used if you are trying to persuade someone.

Examples can be kept as like a precious thing for people. Why this is also important is because if you actually lets say achieve something that you wanted to accomplish for such a long time. You can always remember that thing that made you kept pushing forward, and to never let down what you wanted to do for such a long time. Like for example, a person named Generic_Name made his dream become a reality; which it was to become a architect that works under a famous person. And when he had to make a speech, he remembered a women who was going through exactly the same thing he was going through. And he said that her life will be something he is going to cherish forever because her background is what made him become who he is now. Which everyone can look at for being influenced by this person right here.

Examples can actually change many peoples lives because of what they say or just their background. What made me choose this reason? well it was because for the past 16 years of my life, I have always seen many people change their lifestyle because of what people are saying to change them. Like for example, when I was in 8th grade, I had a science teacher that was really nice to everyone and respected them as if we were like his child. And all of the students asked him ""why did you decide to become a science teacher?"" And his response was ""I became a science teacher because I like teaching about sciences and the life of our society. And because of a man that i was inspired by. And everyone knows who this guy is? His name is Bill Nye The Science Guy. The reason why i choose him was because during my time when i was in collage , he was the only person that i knew that actually did science. And I wanted to watch his show. And I was amazed by all the chemicals, types of rocks, everything that has to do with science. And since that happened, i have enjoyed being a science teacher for 10 years."" And this speech shows that people will not be able to reach their goal unless you have a motivational quote, speech, or background of a famous person.

While i do think that Examples are good to influence other people that are trying to reach their goal, I still kind of personally think that there are examples that don't really help/influence people. Why I think of that is because people don't find examples of influential that aren't interesting or appealing to them at all because it's doesn't suit them. Like for example, there was a kid who wanted a game that could make him play it all the time. And he saw a commericial about a game that is coming out next week, and he was getting suprised at first, but when he saw a interview about the game, he wasn't really amazed anymore because what the game director talked about wasn't influencing other poeple at all. So there are some examples that really can't influences them. But most of the time, there are so many examples that are out there in the world that actually changed peoples lives, and their mind about something. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

For example in the real life students should understand the choice of there carrier because different carriers have different working conditions. This shows that students would enjoy there future. this shows that students would enjoy there choice of there carrier. this shows that students would deal with there working conditions. this shows that students would get better understanding there choice. some people may believe that students should commit a carrier because they would enjoy what those would do. However some students would not would not there carrier because they would think about it cause there other carriers that might interest them.

well most carriers can interest students because it would give them a different experience of what they do. most students might of seen there parents work on there carrier that they might seem interested. this shows that students should see what there parents would do on the carrier that they would interested on .this shows that students would enjoy that experience if they seemed interested. this shows students would be enjoy there experience by the same carrier. this shows that students would enjoy same carrier that there parents work. some people may believe that students would work on same carrier that there parents work on because most students might have the same experience. however students would choose a different that they like.

well most students can go online and learn what carriers could do. Example students would use there computer to learn what carriers can do. this shows that using technology would help them with there interest. this shows they could ask someone that work on a carrier that they interest. this shows that carriers could help out the future. this shows that carriers could have different experience. some people may believe using electronics would help out the carriers that you were interested because they could understand what they do. however other carriers would something different.

However, some people might argue with that, because they think that people should not make their own decisions but they should seek guidance from experts to make a better decisions for them.

First, everyone should depends on himself and make a better decisions in life to get more experience for example a student can't get a good grade unless he makes a decisions to pay attention to the teacher and doing the homework.

Second, people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions for example nobody will be by your side all the time and in the hard situations to help you make a good decision and a person should not just think once but twice and think far and know what are the consequences of every decision.

Third, one decision can change everybody life and that is on of the reasons why people should depend on them self because nobody cares about you more than you. Other reason is most of the successful people they started from nothing but they made a good decisions and they became successful.

D3A6B04B54A9,"Should school have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall? People said most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Some people argue that there should be year round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. However I believe that students should have a longer summer break because a long summer break will give the student time to travel, spend time with their family, and work in summer. The first thing you can do by having a long summer break is travel overseas without worried about how many day you can stay. By travel overseas you need time to explore the country go around the city, and enjoy yourself. Cause travel in a different country you can learn new thing that you never learn anywhere, or experience the thing that you learn in school like go to a history site that you learn from history class. Traveling is not all about playing around didn't learn anything, but you can have your choose of where you want to go, and what you want to do. There are one type of travel that I think is really good for student that they're going to have fun, experience, and still learning. It's the tour during summer break with your teacher, and your schoolmate. It's recommend by school where you can come to a country that you learn about their language, and culture in school. There are a lot of different thing that you need to get ready to go to another country, so you can't get everything done in a week of spring break. The second thing you can do by have a long summer break are spend time with your family, and friends. When summer come you, and your friends plan to go on vacation together because all of you have the same summer time even if ya'll come from a different school. Because all the schools doesn't have a same winter break, or spring break that is the reason why you, and your friends can't go to vacation together. Family is the most important thing for everybody. On summer you can spend more time with your family, or go visit cousin. Summer are the students break, but their parent still have go to work. The 3-4 week summer break is too short for students to have a chance spend time with their family. For overseas students that even worse they're study in a year, but still don't has a chance to come back to see their family just because the short amount of time that they have for break. The third problem is the student work on summer break most student are get their job during the summer. Because with the amount of time you available to work for them, they will hire you. For a student work in the summer is the best choose when you work on summer you can save a big amount of money to use during the year, and don't have to go work during school year, so you can be more focus in school. With a week off in winter break, or spring break you can't find a job because the short amount of time. Some people say their should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and week off spring and fall. It's will help the student return to school without forgot everything that they have been learn. However I disagree with this idea I believe there should be a long summer break by that student can do what they want, and still learning new thing. I think a long summer break is the best time in a year for students travel overseas to study in the United State like me. Because this is the only time in the year we can come back to the motherland to meet us family, and visit cousin. During school year we can't come back to our country to celebrate holiday like Christmas, or mother day...etc. We have to celebrate a lone because the limit of the time won't let us make it home. A long summer break will help the student overseas spend more time with family because there are enough time for them to get ready, and travel a long way home. For students that live in United State you can go travel with your family to make more memory. When students have enough time to enjoy them self in summer it will help them return for school in a exciting way, so they can learn faster. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5
FE8BA4043788,"Is it true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life?. Well, success is a strong word, there are some people that do not get where they want to be because the way they think. Our actions depend on how our thinking is.

It is true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life, if you have a goal and you really work hard to achieve it , you are always thinking ""I can do it"" and you are being positive about it, you have the idea that you will get whatever you want to get.

In addition there are many people who really want to get something or get to somewhere, but their minds are always thinking negative, they feel like they will not do good or they will not success, it makes them not keep trying. For example, when I was in middle school I had a classmate who will always think he was a ""looser"" he will always said that he could not do anything, his parents did not love him, so many horrible things that will make feel sad, I always tried to make him feel better by saying positive things about him, but I thing that is all about the ideas we put in our minds.

Success depends on our actions too,sometimes we let other people decide for us, we either do what they said or we act the same way they act. Some of this people do not have a positive attitude to help you success. we create a plan that we have to work on to be successful, even though that we need to have a positive attitude. We have to make it happen no matter what, try as hard as you can! because if you just have a positive attitude but you are not trying hard an off, is not worth it, I seemed some people that are very good at something because thats all and the only thing they do :However they don't try to keep going further, and when they are in a situation that things are more challenging they give up!

EC7A73638669,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I agree with this position. I believe that it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college one year early. Although, some people think that it is not a good idea for students enter college or the work force one year early, nevertheless it can be helpful, because it can help students to start early to college, then they can have enough time to choose what they will want to study, and it also going to promote them to be eficients and take adventage of the time, they will have.

When people have to take a important decision, regularly, they think and they look carefully at all their options. If the students graduate one year early, they will earn time to correctly choose what profession they going to take, and then they will have enough time to elect the college or university where they feel comfortables to go. This is significant, because of one decision depend the future; the experiences that people going to live. With enough time students can give attention to their most important interests, thoughts, and consider possibles changes if it's require. Also people can take adventages of the time that they have, one year is not too much, but in one year is the opportuny for students to select a exceptional career and work and what they always dreamed.

The time is a investment and students have to take advantage of that. Some parents, students, and techers think that if the students graduate a year early, they don't will have time free to play, to share with their families, or to do others activities. The reality is that it going to improve the performance of the students. This method will catch the attention of them and it will show them their priorities. The children have the right to have their free time, but also the parents have the labor to teach them that are precedences that they have to comply with. For example, I took English 10, in summer school in Generic_City, but I was living in Generic_City, I drove every morning, one hour to arrive to my summer school, it was hard wake up early and then drive, but now, I'm sure that it was the best desicion because I'm at few steps of my graduation. People always have to remind that to can get extraordinary rewards, people have to do extraordinary efforts.

On the other hand, some people are not agree with those that offer the special program to graduate early. The opposition believe that students are not sufficiently prepare to graduate before of the schedule time. The contrary side, also think that students have to complete all their high school years to be ready to go to the college or the work. People that is in the opposite side not coincide with the programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years. In addition, some parents are not agree with the options that the program give to their children; to take courses during the summer or in the evenings. Parents refer to this like ""a extra pressure to students."" There are people that suggest that the better choice is that the students complete their four years of high school; however, it can prolong that time for students to graduate.

To conclude, it's important emphasize that in certain cases the pressure is a tool that help people to protrude in their projects and in the life in general. When people take risks and they have the courage to do reality their goals, they going to achieve all of them. The time that people invest in positive accions are transcedent to achieve their goals. The program offer a essential support to students, that going to be useful and it going to show to students that they have the capacity of achive their goals, before that they believed, they just have to establish their academic purposes and demostrate that they have the capacity to achieve it. The program is a great oportunitty to grow and success, one year can be the big difference, and it can approach us closer of that dream.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
7CB712FD1253,"There are some some school's that offer 3 years to graduate but then there are some school's that are still doing Traditional way's of the 4 year's of high school and in my opinion is that it is good to graduate early and go to college or the work force but it also depends on the person thats doing all this work to graduate high school or the evenings or night school but people still do it and its good. The people that are doing all this work are hard working people who want to follow through with there ideas and dreams in life and they are paying good for it by studying and working hard throughout high school and they keep on working hard to reach for there goal outside of high school. In my opinion It's a great idea to finish all of high school within 3 years because that's hard work paid off but some people believe that if you stay in school for an extra year that makes you smarter but in some sense that could be true but sometimes people stay the extra year because for 1 they sometime's stay because they fell behind and sometimes it's because they need one type of class for college but in reality the people who did the 3 year's of high school are the truly advanced one's because they did everything within 3 years and its good for them.

if these people go into the work place they have a higher chance of getting the job that they want because they have a high school diploma and the fact that they graduated school early so they that as an advantage for them when they find a job and most jobs are only looking for people that are either in high school or have a diploma because some job's just want people with brains so they could work smarter and not harder but the truth is these people are doing everything to make a living because they worked really hard in high school now they're working really hard at a job and now they are succeeding in life because they were smart and graduated earlier then everyone else

In the case that going to college after graduating the three year's are also good because they want to get into a field of a type of job that they wanted and now they're working even harder for it but in reality its working smarter not harder because they are studying for a career that will give them more money no matter what because they are studying for 4 more years to achieve there dream of becoming something in this world and they are smarter by doing that because a dream job is one of the thing's everyone want's and its good to have a goal in mind.

In my conclusion is that going to college is the better one because It's working smarter not harder and that's the better idea instead of working hard and not being able to get paid enough like the people at the college do so in my state of fact that college if the better choice to go with out of high school no matter if you did 3 years or traditional 4 years of high school the best choice is after high school to go to a college or a university that makes life better in the end for everyone. Some people like to chose the route of hard work but its truly good to head to a college or university after school is over fo0r this person.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

We use technology everyday ,but technology can cause less contact with people and a distraction. Although some say technology has a positive effect on lives ,actually it has negative effect on lives.

Despite the fact that technology gives negative effects it actually gives positive effects as well. We use technology everyday it is a part of our life. Technology helps us in many ways for example our jobs, many of our jobs involve technology and the use of it helps us get our job done succesfully and easier. We use technology to commuincate for exanple a cell phone is used to communicate with other people this helps us know where people are if needed or just to see how they are doing. We use technology in school for example computers, cell phones, these devices help students on their everyday assigments it helps them use the internet when needed and it helps teacher with their teaching as well.

Technology causes a distraction. For example cell phones are used every day in schools cell phones distract students from their learning and their peers around them also. While using these moblie devices when not asked to students grades go down and they don't show interest in school anymore. These cell phones are not only a distraction they are an addiction to people. Another example driving while using your cell phone, this can cause a distraction and that can lead to a car crash. Some people are texting while driving or playing music and even the gps is a distraction because you are looking down at the gps instead of keeping your eyes on the road. This shows us distraction can make you loose focus or not pay attention your surrondings.

Cell phones can cause less contact with other people. When using your cell phone you don't look up while walking you just keep your head down this is usually the case with teenagers and kids. Teenagers don't interact with parents, peers and family memebers anymore becasue of these moblie devices. These devices can cause people to not have interaction skills for example people don't know how to approached some one if talked to. This show us that with this technology we are loosing our social skill we don't even know how to say hi to someone anymore it is very sad what technology is doing to us it is stripping us away from the world.

Despite the fact that some say technology has a positive effects it actually has a negative effect. Technology is part of the human life we can't take it way anymore.

Also I would see fresh fruit growing from the trees. And also I would see a beautiful area with flower bushes.

Sometimes I think in a world that makes me something else wants me to see everything. This can maybe explain that I am on top of a mountain or a hill.

01B3FDB3FD57,"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Now imagine yourself as a beginning engineer, sitting at your desk, aggravated because you can't come up with a new invention. All you have around you are textbooks but no image or thought of what your invention may be. If only you could imagine a new invention of some sort then maybe you could build something. But with no imagination, how can you build knowledge? I agree with Einstein's quote. I believe imagination is more important than knowledge.

I agree with Einstein's quote because having imagination is how we've had all our inventions yet. Without imagination how were many of the things we own invented? For example, the telephone. The telephone couldn't have been invented without someone imagining a device where you could communicate without leaving your home. You need imagination in order to make new things. Another example would be the camera. Whoever invented it, had to have imagination in order to think of a device that captures any moment almost in an instant. Even I, as a student, need imagination in order to make new things. For example, when making an essay, such as this one, I need to imagine of a good story hook that goes along with the prompt.

Furthermore, I believe in Einstein quote because without imagination, knowledge is almost useless. For example, when learning a new vocabulary list. You may know all the definitions but you can't put them in your own words or use the words in different instances. Why? Because you can't imagine it. You can't picture it, you just know the definitions. Another example is when reading a book. Knowing how to read isn't even near of what you need to fully comprehend a book. You need to imagine it. Picture the story in your mind in order to fully understand the book's theme, setting and tone.

Lastly, I agree in Einstein's quote because without imagination, all our decisions would be made carelessly. For instance, before you speak or move, most of the time you imagine what the outcome of that action will be. If not, the outcome won't be for the better. Another instance is when in an experiment, you hypothesize what the result of the experiment will be. That takes imagination. When signing a contract, it's needed to imagine the consequences of signing and not signing the contract. In other words, you need to imagine things before you decide to take them on. Knowledge isn't the only thing that will help you when making decisions.

In conclusion, Einstein's quote is correct in my perspective. Knowledge isn't the most important factor to have, imagination is key to everything you do and will do. You can't fully understand most things without imagining them. Can't go on inventing things before imagining them first. Also, you won't be able to make good decisions before imagining the outcome. All in all, imagination is also how you'll enjoy your life. Knowledge is great and all but it can't bring others as much happiness as imagination can. It's how we've been happy for all these years. Imagination is how we have gone so far in this world and how much we've survived.                 ",4.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.5

Thanks to the opportunity Mc Donald's gave to work there I gain a lot of knowledge on treating costumers. Now I can say that am confident and willing to work with others and help costumers.

At the moment I'm involved in the auto tech classes and am a member of the engine building team which take place after school. Being in this classes has help me learn and gain experience on cars. This classes have taught me how to be organized and clean with the tools. In the engine team I learn how to be faster on everything and also being careful. Graduate being a Auto technician is my goal.

When I first came to the United States I needed to work, thats when I started working in landscaping with one of my older brothers. working in landscaping is hard, you have to deal with heavy equipment sometimes. I remember my brother use to put a lot of pressure on me sometimes, because he needed the job to be done in one day. There I learn how to control myself during peer pressure. Thanks to my brother now I know how to use power equipment and delicate tools.

With all this being said I will like to be selected to go visit your dealership and learn more about it. I see many oportunities for me at your dealership. I will like to have an Idea of what are the requirements to pursue the auto tech field. With all my experience I'm positive and confident that I can achieve my goal of being a technician one day. I will also like to thank you for taking your time to read this letter.   ",3.5,3.5,4.0,2.5,3.0,3.0

F57B95D17755,"No not good for older and younger students to be in a program. But sometimes older kids become mean and don't care about the younger just care themself to have fun. It's not normal for that to happen and it will feel weird harder stuff for the younger ones don't know and the older kids think it's too easy. There's so much reasons that it shouldn't happen doesnn't feel right.

If it was like in the summer for an activity that would be great because you learn about how the older and younger kids are. The younger kids will want to do childess stuff and the older ones want to just be on there phones and just talk. Sometimes the older ones need to teach the younger ones to be more grown up so they learn about the older ones. The teachers mostly will try to tell the older ones to help the younger ones to be grown up.

So usually they shouldn't create schools like that it will feel completly different because there will be different stuff then real schools with older and older kids and younger and younger kids. The younger ones could sometimes scream and run or goof around a lot and the older ones sometimes will feel annoyed by them. So lot's times I feel like the older ones will feel unconfortable from the little ones. When you grow older you learn what you do now and not like when you were younger.

Most the time you usually want to be friends with people your age not too much of a different age. Sometimes it can happen to be friends with someone older or younger but most times your age. Always try to be yourself and not change your additude. Sometimes the older kids will need to try make the little kids happy by talking with them and have fun with them. But not for to long you should because it will get boring doing it for a long time. When u finshis they will sometimes try bothering you because they liked what you did but just leave them alone after.

These are examples why sometimes you should or shouldn't allow those schools with older and younger students. After when you grow older you the one teaching the new kids to be grown up. Try remeber the times you were little and what the older kids did to you do that with others. But there could be lot's of times younger ones a different and you were that way 8 years ago.

In my opinion, I'am totally agreed to his wisdom of words by Wilson, Churchile, because there are many persons in general that could shows that the fauilures is part of success without loss of love to what we do.

82F9FDBD6F98,"My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe and they can get rest for school.

Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because it's dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. also can have a guardian to pick you up when its late so this scenario would not happen.

Another reason is to get some good rest for school and have lots of energy. If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. An example for this is a teenager could be outside and they do not have a curfew so the teenager comes home late. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and can't concentrate.

A good counter claim for both is you can just stay home and don't have worry about a curfew or going home really late. because if you are scared to go home late or can't get some rest just stay home. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. And parents should just be more protective so they don't end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school.

with both arguments i think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

For example lets say that i was trying to become a professional soccer. I played for the best clubs, i was named the best player in the team, and i have never been cut from a team. One day my coche tells me that there is a professional soccer try out next week and he want me to get ready. So he gives me a schedual on what i should be doing to get fit. Everyday i have to eat right and train hard. I did all of those things somedays i did not want to train and just start eating unhealthy but i fought through it. Try out day comes and i was ready as i will ever be. we started out with warm ups and went to drills. I was amazing. i was like the best player at the fiald. at the end of the day they gathered every body up and called all the people that made it. I was not one of them. I have failed to become a pro soccer player. Now this is the part where enthisiasm playes a role. I can eather stop playing soccer and choes a diffrent routh or i can pick my head im and try again.

5EE526AB840B,"How can a students learn more from home than attend classes in school?. A student has more benefits if they attend to classes in schools because if the student can not understand a topic or has questions about it, the teacher can not explain by video conferencing as a teacher that can explain face to face an be sure that student understood. My second reason is a student does not have a person who trust or a person to appeal if He/She are passing for any personal or familiar problem. In schools We can find a lot of person as a teachers, counselor, police members, and psychologist to help students. My last reason is a student has to socialize with other students to be prepare for his/her future.

Firstly, if a student can not understand a topic and has questions about it, they can feel more comfortable to ask and said

""I do not understand, can You explain me again?, if they are with the teacher face to face. Generic_Name (My friend's name) decided to take the classes online, in the beginning He was so excited, but after one month He told me that was not a good choice because He does not feel comfortable asking a lot of question about one topic by the computer, and when He not understood something, He just do not said anything to the tacher who is given him classes by video conferencing.

Secondly, in schools we can find many ways to be help if we have any problem in home. Teachers, counselors, any person who works in the school can help us. In my junior year I had a classmate who was attending to the school but then she change her classes to online, When I ask her why she change her classes She told me that her mom was fired of her job and She had to start working to support her family. She was 16 when that happened she felt alone with nobody who help her.

Lastly, students has to socialize with other students to feel the sensation of surpassing. If they just does not want to attend school because they are shy or they does not like to interact with other students, We are not educating a good citizen. Students has to feel the sensation of surpassing when they do their homework or when He/She finished their assignments, that sensation the student can not lose. I read in a newspaper a case about Generic_Name, He was 16 when He attended to online classes, He never like attend to school when He discover the option for students to attend classes from home he decided take it. because He never like to interact with other students. After 2 years he graduated, but he never were prepare to socialized with persons, and that affects his personal life.

In conclusion, the offer to learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing in not a good idea because all of them are under 18, They does not have a good criteria to take that big decision that can bring serious consequences or affect their life.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

It could be a girl or a boy that they're interesting on and their first impression may not be how his/her boss want it to be.

But if they're really interesting on that boy or girl who want the job or went to meet them they may give them a second chance to make their really good impression and that man/woman that like or want to obtain or to meet they will work really hard to get what they want ,they will search or obtain imformation on how to be presentable or to act in their interviews or when you're meeting someone you are interesting on.

7949A941BF0F,"What is success without failure?

I can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. Human behavior mostly influences in their achievements and failures throughout life. To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. I strongly agree with the Churchill's statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes.

Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world.

Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it.

Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow other's behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end.

Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes.

In my opinion it helps you improve your friendly skills. Soccer helps you on how to work in teams. I've seen some famous soccer players on TV play. At first when they join a team they don't get along with the rest. But when time goes by they start working as a team. It helps them talk to others and work as one team.

Also, when you play soccer you have to think what you're going to do next. So soccer helps you improve your thinking skills. Most people are not good at thinking fast. It would be helpful for them to play soccer. It can help you think of new ideas. maybe in an emergency it might help you think faster on what to do. it can also help you develop new ideas. It makes you pick the best choices you have and what to do with them. Playing a sport it's going to help you in the future, even if you think it's not.

Finally, soccer is a fun sport to play, because it helps you run around and exercise. It can help you stay healthy and stay in shape. Nowadays people don't like to play sports. They just be in their house watching TV shows,playing video games, or just doing nothing. People focus too much on the internet that they forget how to play sports and do fun stuff.

Another is it will make you feel that you could do anything. For example, if Generic_Name wins the art fair only in her class, but the school is having an art fair for the whole sophomore class. Her self-esteem will kick in and she may sign up

Also you can learn how to not give up for example if Generic_Name lose the class discussion but the class is going to have another one the next day she is going to try her hardest to win the next class discussion.

The first reason why students would benefit from attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, is because of those kids with disabilities who wants to go to school ,but are afraid of being bullied because of their physical appearance. I remember when i was young , i used to get bullied in school because of my bow legs. Kids could laugh at me , and that used to hurt my feelings at the point of not willing to go to school.

This same thing is still happening today to a lot of kids in different schools , that they don't want to go to school because of being bullied and judge for their physical appearance yet they can't do nothing about it . That's why classes from home by way of online would be so important to kids who are going through this kind of situations.

I had a friend who had a very bad disease that could't allow her go outside where there is sunlight because it could burn her skin. She wanted to go to school but she couldn't because of her health condition. The classes from home by way of online helped her finished her high school studies and graduated.

Some people may disagree by saying that students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online, because they won't have fun, make friends and other things, however i believe that they would benefit because a lot of those students who take classes from home by the way of online, ends up finishing their studies, and their wouldn't be any difference from the one who made it in school.

The students required of many classes to accomplish their knowledge, but some people think that students need to take a music, drama,or an art class because:

I think that students will need those classes to graduate. To get school diploma students will have to accomplish some classes like music,drama,or an art class. they should use those classes for distraction their mind to the other classes for examples math, history and science class then, they will get relaxation. Also, I think that some people wants the students take those classes because those classes represent happiness, peace and an individual talent that every person have. but some people get frustrated that they don not have any talent like sing, act or draw. Some people want that the students take those classes because they need to develop their mind in something productive for the society and for them. No think in bad things or bad actions.

Also,I think that some people think that students should be take a music,drama,or art class because students have the potential to protrude in the great music,drama and art world. To prove to the society the capacity that they may have and that they are the future. They will replace the people that do music drama and art in our present for example artists,painters and others.

I think that some people believe that students should be take music,drama and art classes because is the only way to develop their mind,knowledge and to learn new things that help them for the future. Those classes help the students to get a mental and physical develop because the music make us to express feelings,emotions,or give to the audience a message that we want that they know and understand. The drama help us to develop our mind,but also,help us to use our body to express something that we want that people will know. The art class help us to represent,express and get abilities that students will do not know that they have. With those classes students will be exactly what they are and feel because they will express anything that they may want without get frustrated.

In conclusion some people believes that students should be take music,drama,an art class because they need new persons that express and give to them that knowledge that represent those classes because those students that will learn are the future and are the new generation. Also, because students need express feelings,emotions and develop their knowledge. Because they think that the students are interesting in others things that is not productive and they need to learn those important topic to not be loss and continue with the music, drama and art in our world.

But I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts. The first reason that I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is that you can learn new things in your life doesn't matter if you make a mistake. The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is that a expert does know every thing about your life does know your feelings.

The most important lessons life can give is stand your ground, be more forward with certain individuals, cut what seems to be negative. Individuality can always be a good, sometimes you never need that helping hand because not everyone is helpful. Some try to be the bad person by stepping over you.

Most experiences, I myself have gone through were never the best. Everyone might seem like the good person, but we never know what is really behind them. First off, you should simply just stand your ground. Show them that not everything is meant to be worked within two people.

Another reason, achieving things on your own shows you a lot of things you never knew before. One of those might be you have made through school by yourself and got your diploma. Accomplishment comes with many struggles and steps. Not just anyone makes it through; some give up because maybe others told them that not everything is for them.

Lastly, cut out certain people that you know never got you anywhere. Everyday is a lesson if we recognize it or not. Some days are harder than others, but there is never a day you should give. Every job can be easy with a positive mindset.

51C93A7260DE,"Have you ever thought what school would be like for you and other, students in your school would have a program where older and younger kids will gather around, do different activities and projects and learn at the same time.

Think about programs you will want to be included in your school,that will help you learn faster and make you understand things better and differently,you will also get help and subjects you have struggles on a daily bases. In my opinion i feel like students feel more better and cofterble talking to students there age just because it might be easy for them to explain things better to someone who is the same age. There's times where student's feel more pressured by an adult so that's what makes them not want to ask for help.

Now think to yourself and ask yourself if you find it better, having a program where all students can gather around just to ask for help when is needed and so socializes with them. Because theirs always time you get to school and talk to your everyday friends but you dont really know theres other people you havent met yet so making a program for everyone is a good way to get to know others in the program.

So with all that being said if you want to have a program at your school, that will help you and other student's gather around and bond together like friends and get to know everyone in your school. Is not just in the program that will be in your school but people that you walk by every other day gather around and teach everyone something new and they can give back to you and teach you something new everyday to anyone in the program.

First, first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at new school because people can look at you by the way you are quite, shy, and serious. But once they start to get to know you they start realizing that you are talkative, loud, and fun to hangout with. Their first impression of you starts to change. For example, when I met Generic_Name I thought she was ignorant, rude, and selfish but when I started to hangout with her I noticed that she was a sweet and caring girl. And we became really good friends even my first impression of her from the beginning changed.

Second, first impression are possible to change when you go to an interview at work because when you arrive at the interview it may seem that don't have the courage to work by the way you act. Meanwhile those impressions start to change because they notice that you actually want to work and you want to put an effort on the job. For example, When I went to an interview for a job the manager thought that I didn't actually wanted to work and that I wouldn't take it serious just by the way I look. Later on he realized that I actually wanted the job even that I would take it serious. In other hand some people think that by the way I talk or my face impression, people think that I won't get the job because I would not take it serious but they are wrong because once they start to get to know me. They start realizing that I actually want the job.

Todays technology allows people to do many different tasks without having contact with others in a positive way. Technology today is now making it easier for us humans to do things and also showing us what the furture could look like in a couple of years. Why would this be a negative thing ? if people are just trying to make are lives easier. For an example lets say you need to get some where but fast and you don't have a ride there is now a app where you send your location and give the address to place you need to go and somebody will take you. Technology is such a great thing and its becoming greater each and everyday.

There are many different types of apps that you can download on your phone today for anything. lets say that your at home and your really hungry but you don't want to leave the house you can download an app called grubhub that will make sure you dont miss a meal. what is grubhub its an app that delivers food from anywhere. All you do is tell the person what you want to eat the location of the place to pick up the food and your address so they know where to drop it off. And its that easy this thing that we call a phone can make all this happen with a little bit of typing. these apps are for free too but it may cost for the food but not everything is free in life.

Computers are also a big part of technology. Computers and laptops are used everyday could be for school for work for anything. Computers help out a lot in school for anyone who needs to do research and any type of information he or she did not know about. Laptops are great aswell its a computers that folds and is for on the go great for anyone that travels a lot or somebody that works on computers alot.

first of all, kids have to do homework and important projects and that's because they have final project for the quarter, but you have to do community service what do you rather do i rather do my project for the quarter.

they will have more privacy they will have a flexible schedule, and they can take the class when they want.

they will not miss any class for any weather changes, etc.

The best example is when AiDiSheng developed light blob he had thousands of fails but he didn't give up, he didn't loss enthusiasm,after more fails finally he made the first light blob in human life. It tells me If you don't loss your enthusiasm on something thing you focus on keep doing it you will done it perfectly like what you wished.

My other reason is be audacious keep trying. when you are failure to failure, your friends might say stop doing it you are not going to make It .they just giving you a suggestion.

If you stop you will loss your enthusiasm on something that is attracting you just because they said are not going to make it, trust yourself keep trying don't loss your enthusiasm.

In my opinion enthusiasm is not easy to have, the only ways to have Is someone or something that is attracting me. I would like to focus on I will have enthusiasm like video games I can play for a whole day,but I can't study for whole day It will be tough to me what If I have enthusiasm on study I will be success too.

A72FE8731B45,"Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I would'nt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. In my opinion. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch.

Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that it's disgusting. When I was younger I would'nt eat at school and until this day I don't because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids don't eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school.

When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woud'nt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she did'nt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I would'nt eat. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that would'nt eat in school.

I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren don't eat at school. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coud'nt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve.

In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol.           ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0

I think we should ask people for there opinion because they might have a better thought. For example if you wanted to go shopping for cloths and you dont know which one to pick. People will give options of what they think and they can tell you which one they prefer more. There are variety options you can pick from. You can choose your own and ask people if they like it or not. If you dont know which one to pick between two options. You can ask friends, family, or anyone you feel comfuterble with you can get an idea which one you want more. Its always a good thing to ask for people opinion.

Asking for people opinion is good they can have different options for you. You can ask on different flavor of ice cream you can get as many options as you want . People can give you differnt opionions on what they think which ice cream taste better than other ones. different options is always a good thing to use. Its bad sometimes haveing only one option the more options the better. The more options you get you wont have problems with picking things of what you want. It is easier to to pick and and you can have what you want.

All these opinions can help us out later in life. In the future you might need help on which flavor ice cream is good. You can ask someone and they can give you an opinion which one is good. Its good to have opinion some of them you might not like. Everyone dont have the same opinion which is okay everyone can have different opinion on different types of things. over time you might need an opinion on something and you can thing what people have said before or you can ask someone to help you out.

In point of view, it is good idea because when students finish their high school in three years, they also can work, and save money to enter college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma, and start to apply in some college. Also, students can find better jobs with their diploma.

First, it is good idea for students graduate and obtain their diploma because some students need the diploma to enter college. For example, my friend Generic_Name needed her diploma and start to apply in summer to enter at the

Hampton University. Furthermore, students who's want to achieve their diploma in three yaers, they have to work hard. But some students wants to achieve their goals without make any kind of effort.

Second, students can find better jobs with their diploma because if you don't have any diploma you cannot work in a proffessional job where people pay more. For example, my sister Generic_Name have to work after she graduate from from high school, but she need a good job to save money to enter one year later at college and pay her first semester. Instead, some students have to work because they don't have any type of help from their families.

If students have to work is because they want to enter college.

Third, some students cannot finish their high becuase they have to work for maintain themself. For example, my cousin Generic_Name cannot finish his studies because he have to work at 3:00 pm to 10:00 pm so he don't have time to his asignments of high school. Some students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to pay bills from their homes. Also, they don't have a better job to pay their studies from college and its harder to them to obtain the diploma from high school.

In conclusion, it is good idea for students finish their high school in three years and enter to college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma. So students can find better jobs with their diploma and pay their studies from college. But, students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to work and pay bills from their homes.

You can show how it is all organized and where everything is at to get anything fast when it is need for the product to be done in order to sell it to the people.

What is the cost for all the meltarsils of the company to be able to run correctly so not a lot of money is put in to it and get broke and struggle with money that is needed.

Going to a company can help others if they want to work in a company.

Some people want to see how it feels to work or be a manager and time to put in to work.

What will a company do if they run out of money and supplies dose the company need to be sold.

Will a company pay lots of money for the bills from most of the elctristy. will a company get in to trouble if the supplies they make is not good? All companies are big but some are bigger than other because they sell there stuff faster and get more money from it and they get better stuff to use and make there company even bigger with better stuff to make the supplies and surly more employees. every company makes there own stuff they can't tack other people supplies and take the credit of the managers.

What wll happen if on company steals an idea form someone will they get a fine of a lot of money are they will go to jail for stealing the idea of the other company.

Will all companies have work all the time.

Do companies work on festive days like Christmas or new years.

Will employees get some days to have vacation.

After all the work is done all the machine get turned off if in a festive day.

When a employ gets sick do they have to call the manager to say they can't go or they just don't go and wait if the manager calls him because he wasen't there.

If they get sick during work will replacement person come to replace them for the days or in tell they feel better.

When there is a fire will they get money from all the thing they got destroyed or that don't work any more.

It will be nice if students can go to the companies and see how it is like to be a manger or employ or even a expert so the can control the money so they don't get broke in the future of the company.

Know everyone will know how it feels to be a manager or employ of any job that needs the manager or employs.

All of the these will help and see how it feel to control the company and how they do it and when get sick while in work.

19DDF17CA4DC,"When you see people doing their work do you sometimes think they are feeling alone doing their work. I mean the teacher ask them if they want to work with a group or do it alone but they always chose to do it alone because they don't know anyone in the class or they don't feel like working with anyone that means they wanted to look cool about it. so that would mean more work for them, What i feel that is more beneficial is working in a group.

When working in a group you have less work to do because everyone has a different job to do for example, let's say you have a project and it is a group project everyone has a job to do like one person could be doing research, another person can be working on the poster/PowerPoint,and the last person can be the one presenting it to the class.

people could say that working alone is better and much quite, However working in a group means to making new friend and getting the work done much faster.

Working in a group isn't really that bad you can have some fun when you are working in a group like making new friend asking when they can stay after so you can do the project together or going to each others houses planning on what you should do with your project. But it is really fun when you are working with your friends,Working with your friends is fun because you would be laughing all day and you might or might not get some work done but that just depends on the kind of friend group you have. There are some who would be focus and get the work done but there are others who would be laughing and get nothing done.

people could say that working with friends is distracting, However having to work with your friends would be really easy and fun.

It's much easier for the students to work in group the can get together and work things out with each other instead of them doing it alone and they don't have anything planed like no ideas at a lot then it's good to have a group because they can bring new ideas. New plans like everyone can have their ideas on their project plus it would be nice seeing what the student made see what each student has. It just shows that everyone had different themes of there project. so when you work alone you just only see one persons ideas and that fine but when you are in a group you see everybody ideas.

Other might people say that one mind is good enough, However many minds would make a differences.

The reason people work by their self is because they might think that working in group is too distracting and it's not fun when people keep on talking. But working with other people will help make things faster and fun but also you get to give your own opinion about things and you get to work together plus you get to learn a lot from your group.

Some parents will not agree I think because they will be working and they don't know with who they can leave their kids with. Video Conferencing could work for students instead of online classes because that way the person that will come to teach you can explain more better from the assignments that your suppose to do. Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing. Students will benefit from being abkle to attend classes from home will some students they would rather take classes home then school because in school they think it's more harder for them for the reason of being with alot of stusdents.

F1B4412674FE,"My thoughts on what author Ralph Waldo had wrote, is something I can agree with. The things i have experience and has made me the person I'am today, has taught me that doing the same things will not help me learn and grow. Being fearless and taking a risk on something, will change me and anyone else to a more powerful and successful person.

When I was young, my parents had gotten me a bike with training wheels, I had started to ride it and it was pretty difficult to ride. Every day when I came home from school, I would go outside and ride my bike. I started to get better and better, I was'nt struggling anymore. My parent had saw that I have gotten the hang of it and told me that I should try and do it with out the training wheels. I was to afraid and nervous that I wouldnt be able to ride the bike with training wheels so I didn't let him take them off. He told me that if don't take the wheels off, how will I grow and take risks in life when im older and have big things that i'd have to develop and learn what I made a mistake on not doing and learn from my mistake. So i started to think to myself, ""If i didn't take them off how will I know that im good or horrible"". I told my dad to take them off, once he took them off i was pretty scared but then i started to get better and better that i wasn't afraid. I was pretty proud of myself and gave me courage.

Once you've done something in your life that was huge and still did the same thing over and over what would you grow from it. You are in this world to learn and grow. To become a stronger, and successful person to accomplish something big and grow from where they have started. If someone was to started off as a employee at McDonald and was thinking of being a manager somewhere and have his own company how could he do that if he's just a worker at McDonald. If he wanted to be a manager and own his own company, he would have to be the hardest worker there and show that he can handle and work and follow all the rules. He ends up getting a raise and is the employee of the month for showing that he's a hard worker. the manger realizes that he's got a big future ahead of him. Year's later, he's a manager at his own company and is being successful in life he's learned that not giving up and risking things to become what he is now is incredible.

Last but not least, if someone is not challenging them self, how would they know that they are good at it and could be able to do so much. Ralph Waldo has gave people the courage and make them think that they can do anything to become someone you'd never thought you could be. If you believe you can do anything then you are growing and realizing that all you need to do is to be fearless and take risks. That's the point of growing. I have learned so much and ready to learn more and to become successful in my life. The statement Ralph Waldo had wrote is something i agree with and will grow to be successful.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
C1314085435C,"I agree with Ralph waldo Emerson because he say that if you try to do something you will never grow and that mean you can't do anything with Emerson. but that is not possible to do that if he say that the people will be scared with that thing but if I agree with Emerson he can do something about opinion and the people they can do the other opinion and to understand, and how we can agree with other, we can agree something is very important Emerson he can need to stop how to agree or to take out if we do agree we can do each ether. and we can grow we can stay down, he can keep it up not down if will be down how that will be not grow that need to grow is not to stay down.

545E9BF477C1,"the reason i think that we should not have more school time is because some people in school would not be able to keep up with other kids. and most kids get ttired of being in school for six hours imagine being in school for longer then that and even more kids would start going to sleep in school. because they are already tired of all the classes during the day.

with another good reason that i disagree with adding more time in school is because some people have to do things after school like take care of family or go somewhere important and if you added more time then they would not be able to do get this stuff done because they would be stuck in school learning longer then the time they are accually supposed to get out.

i belaive that there should not add more time to school because it would also be a waste of time because teachers would have to do even more stuff done buy more stuff for students and get more work done grade more papers because we would have a longer school time and then the teachers would have to write more speak more and do stuff more then they would if we had only six hours in a day.

with another reason that i dont thing school should not be longer is that it would not only affect the students and the teachers but it would affect everyone because then the whole school board would have to do more work and the school would loose a lot of money because the school board would have to buy more stuff for students and get more things that kids would need to get everything set up good for the students.

with another good reason we should not have longer school cause if we had longer time kids would not be able to handle so much because they would be learning so many thing in one day and then it would confuse them and when they are going to take a test they would be confused because they were pressured to learn so much in a short period of time and they would not like that because they might fail.

Cell phones have a lot of apps. The apps are easier to handle in a cell phone that in a computer. We the students already have apps for our cell phones were we can see our grades and school calendar. Also with school apps we can email our teachear. Students think thats one good reason to use or phones with education.

Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for education purpose. Many people say cellphones is a great tool for specific things, such as something you may want to know or something you do not know. In my opinion cell phones should not be allow to used it the classroom because students use cellphones all day and do no pay attention, cellphones it can be used for other things, and cellphones distract you.

The students use the cellphones all day and do not pay any attention during class is really bad for students because, they come to school to learn and not be in their cellphones. For example, cellphones it may help you to look for something you might want to know, but when the test and quizzes comes students are not going to know anything because students did not pay attention for being in their cellphones the hall day doing nothing.

Cellphone it can be used for other things, for text with friends or, play games during classes, for watch videos during class, listen to music and not listening on what the teacher is saying. Also students use cellphones to take videos, or photos that they want to search in their social media or just for have fun. For example some students likes to take photos of someone just for have fun or just for bully them in their social media.

Some people say cellphones is a tool to do homework, project, or something you want to do in your cellphone, or when you are confused with something, however cellphones distract you to do those kind of stuff, such as being at your apps and not doing what you suppose to be doing while because you are texting or face timing someone and you get distract and you forgot about to finish your homework or classwork that the teacher have signed you to do,and your grades might go down into a zero if your keep distracting yourself being in you phone during class time.

In conclusion some schools use cell phones in their classroom for educational purpose. Cellphones should not be allow during classroom for educational purposes because students would not learn anything if they are in theirs cellphones during classroom , we know that every student love being in their cellphone during the day, but cellphones will not help student in their educational purposes, and cellphones are not gonna help you learn what you need to learn during students school education.

CF453C152FD5,"This is an easy choice technology has a negative affect on people. There are many reason why but three big ones are. one you lose a lot of communication skills. another is you only see things through your phone. And finally you lose family time or time with friends .

The first reason is people lose communication skills. such as you dont see people face to face you are just texting them and you dont know how to talk to them in person so you dont hang out with them you just text them. and they pretty much just a become and online friend. another example of this is during a job interview you don't know how to talk to someone. it's really hard to do stuff when someone doesn't have communication skills. and you can get food online so you won't have to talk to people.

most people just see things and hear about stuff thats happening. don't go and explore or experience thing the just go on the Internet. because everything around us is technology based. you can't go anywhere without the internet or a TV. so everyone has gotten used to that so they don't have a need to go out or play outside if they have games on there phone,computer,iPad. so people don't have to travel because you can face time people or use other apps to see people. you can order food from uber eats so you don't have to leave your house and people won't know how it feel to be in a restaurant.

finally people wont be spending time with family because of the internet. because someone could be watching a YouTube video and then another then after a while it could be dark outside and you just lost the day and havent said anything to your parents because you have been watching YouTube or Netflix. people get used to that life style and a lot people won't change because its become a habit and its a bad habit to over come. people also forget about there friends because they just wanna be on there phone alone watching videos,playing games , watching TV. and you forget about family and friends not on purpose and you still do it without knowing. And its not just kids it's also adults. They pay everything online so they only leave for work and nothing else. then come back order food or get groceries online. and cook while watching TV or on Facebook .",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

Some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore. Once a read an article on Newsela that was about how a men waited to start his goal, and he ended up getting his goal very quick. The man was called Generic_Name. Generic_Name wanted to save up to buy a house. He started ti save up for two months, later on he won the lottery, Generic_Name was very happy about it, then he deposited all his money into his savings account. Time pass by and he realized he had enough money to buy his dreamed house. Generic_Name bought the house, and he lived happily ever after.

If we are inactive we can wait for the right moment to start and errand or chore. My Aunt(Generic_Name) wanted to do and errand but she decided to wait because she saw on CNN News that if we wait to do and errand or chore the succession rate increases by 25%. She did the errand and it went more smoothly than ever, he waited to do it and she succeeded on doing it.

Being inactive for a while it's good because if we decide to rush things the odds might be against us. My friend Generic_Name always like to rush things. One day he couldn't wait to buy a game that he went in the middle of the night to buy it. When he got to the store, the store was already closed. He walked form the game store to his house. He was very sad that he could not bought the game, later on he saw a women in white standing right in front of him. He woman in white turn down and he saw her.. the we ran like crazy. It's always better to wait to do something such as buying a game, don;t rush things or you will end up like Generic_Name.

I personally want my dream to go to college accomplished by the future, get a career, high education, be the first one in my family that has gone to college.

First of all going to college can help me get the career I want which is game designing. game designing is a career I have wanted to get since I turned twelve years old when I first started playing minecraft. Minecfrat is an awesome game where you can build really cool things that come out of your mind, yo may create a whole new entire world in there. When I turned twelve I always wonder how did they make games go so real so I started reading articles, books, etc. then I stared playing more games and it was incredible. I want to go to college and be able to make my own games because I know people would love playing them. I want to make my own gaming company and kids going around talking about my games. but the only way I can actually do that is by having a college career.

My second reason why I want to go to college is because the majority of people in the United States just drop out of high school. People who dropped out of high school have a really low education degree. I personally want people to think I am smart just by looking at my education record. If u completed your goal in college, if you graduate, people would offer really good jobs to you with a high salary only because your education is high and you know what your doing because they've taught you that in college.

Last but not least I want to be the first one in my family that has actually gone, completed, and graduate out of college. My family is not poor nor is rich we are in the middle class, which I understand why some of my family could not actually afford to go to college. but some people in my family had has the opportunity and they just din't wanted to go because they wanted to live the life, was they're excuse but living the life is not working at a pizza place or McDonald's. I want to demonstrate to all my family, who actually had the opportunity of going to college and din't, that the way they think living the life is wrong. I want them to see that even going to college you can still live the life and probably even better when you have actually graduate. I want for my two little brothers to see, to be proud of their sister and be a good role model for them, so they can follow my steps and get a good live.

We all have our goals that we would like to accomplished in the future. maybe when you grow up you are just going to change plans and do something more important. I want to go to college so I can get a career, I want to go to college so i have a high education degree, I want to go to college to be a good role model to my little brothers and kids in general. going to college is just a really important thing in your live that some people dont get the opportunity to do and some do.",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
6867A6767D25,"An enjoyable educational activity is Avid for anyone that has a dream they want to achieve. The first reason why

I say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go.

In Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and there's no giving up in till we accomplish it. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Not saying you should'nt be friends with that type of people I mean you can but in my perspective don't get involved as much as your other friends is.

Secondly tutorials are a big part of Avid it shows your teachers and peers around you how much you know and how strong you are and the effort you but into a tutorials to get in front of the group and explain what you are having problems with but also helps you learn from your peers and its like sharing the brain cells. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people don't like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials.

In addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students don't have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. It's just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do. One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to King's Dominion and once your there you well be like I've earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something that's giving you the support and keeping you strong. In my point of view I'm working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do.

Avid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they don't because we're a family and something we always say when we're down is ''dream, believe, achieve ''. This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also you're parents and family .

In conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you don't have to pretend to be anyone else. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life.

D06EDF336392,"A city council is debating for the adoption of the curfew for teenagers. That create an enormous positives and negatives reactions the rabble who is for the curfew and who disagree this and said we are in a free country. This laws prohibit to see a teenager on the street at 10 P.M weekday and midnight weekend. In this prompt we will show the reason why the curfew can be a marvelous benefit for teenagers and keep them out of trouble.

In beginning, the decision is reassuring for the parents. For example, when the parents know where their children are that can help them to stay calm. Because sometime we have a parent suffering from high blood pressure and don't know where their children are can affect them. In this case, parents are the main piece of the education of children. When the parent stay at home with their children that can help them to planning the schedule of the sleeping period to be the optimal version of parent of their children. If this case, parents can have a few control into the life of their children. the idea there is to leave a parent with their children to help them to be close and to know each other. Because we have a french proverb what said ""Tell me who do you walking with and I will tell you who are you?"" And the best people for approve your friend and answers us the fabulous question ""Who are you?"" Is our parents.

Furthermore, this law would reduce work of 911. Because everyone know that most of the crime are commit at night and that can not be the moment where we leave our teenagers outside. For example that will help the 911 to reduce call for emergency at night. Because we never know what can happen in a teenagers party, they can do a prank call challenge, they can have a fire in party, or they can fight. In other case, the law can heaven preserve them from eventual aggression in the minor. We do not know who the people who walk in our street and their mentality. We have immensity and variety of people in our street like drugs dealer, a daring, and a rabble we do not go to let our children walking in this environment at night. In this case, the law can decrease a criminality rate in the street. Because teenager are the principal target of people in the street because they are easily influenced. This easily influenced can associate them with a sort of people disreputable.

In auditioning, the curfew can help a teenagers in their education. that can help teenager to study. Because the first priority of a teenager is school and they can have time for studying, that decision can create the future amazing men and women in the future for emergence of our city. In this case, that can help teenagers to sleep early. To have a fantastic performance in everything we doing, we need to have our eight hours of sleeping that is also the case of school. To have a marvelous performance at test and at class we need to sleep the time recommend by a specialist. In this case, teenagers can learn to be organize and responsible. Because the curfew can sharpen their sense of priority what is actually to back home before 10 P.M. And this sense of priority can help them to be a wonderful adult.

Finally,to sum up the situation, we saying our vision about the beneficial effect of the curfew in our marvelous city. The beneficial effect what can impact our the families situations, the local authority, the society and in school, or class. That rule can be very strict for some people, but that is after a long analyze the best way to put our teenagers safe. The curfew can assure the best future for the children in our city and

E24A6E61B08D,"Have you ever ask yourself why do some people are always are their home never go out to socialize with others? Since technology appear in the world, the life of millions of people got a easier way to live, because it brought most of the things and supplies that we need to make our life better and easier.

In my opinion i think technology has positive effect in people's live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school.

Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you dont need to be face to face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who dont have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans cant do.

However technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console , they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it to much but its not the fault of technology its our own responsibility to take care of our health.

Technology affects peoples life by reducing their contact with others but at the same time it brings a lot of benefits to our generation and the future.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

Some people have a hard life more when they trying to be better because some of them feel like they are failure by not having a good jod, or by living in a bad place.

Firts, for some peolpe is hard to find a good jod that they can really appreciate be good finalcially. To be sure that they can have evething they want for life because soometimes people try get somenthing but they can't. It's better to force their self to get whta they really want. For example if tey trying to go out they have to make sure they dont have anydebitos they having pay yet.

Second, some peolpe that livi in a bad place is depend by the econom. Some of them says they loss the enthusiasm by not having a good palce.

Thinking about pleople that really do thinks in live to get a good life is depend on they record. For example the people that go out and find hte way to move from they old life they had to take alot of choice. Or have making alot of bad choises to get something they do have now.

For the people that have evething is more easy to do the things they have i their mind.

On the way tha they can doevething they like or they want. but the enthusiasm they will have will be alot of better them what others can have. In conclusion everyone have a diferent way of life that they have to be grateful for everething. For others is a good way they have to tell then that they alway have to keep they enthusiasm up and never lose.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
F6AA88DC9ACA,"Although it may seen that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" it actually right. But having something that you master it doesn't mean that trying something new you would failed. But giving up it's what would cost you to never grow, for example changing your life style by eating right and going to the gym is not going to be easy but you still going to give it a try. The reason why is that we want to challenge our self in a new environment that we never thought our self would be challenge our self in. Another reason would be that trying something new mean that we are looking for something that we would enjoy or like.

For example we teach our self how to cook but we know that we never knew how to cook but that doesn't mean we are not going to give it a try. That why we try new things because we want to challenge our self in a situation that we never knew that we could solve it or give up. Another reason is that we love trying new things because we are curious if we can master it another example would be is raising a kid wondering if we got everything and teaching them what is right and what is wrong. That what we love trying new things to see if we can do it or not. That what is more important trying new things and see if we can master it because we are capable of doing thing not a computer can't do and that it trying to learn new things.

We can master anything in our way because we are willing to find out if we can do this, if can not fear it, if we got this, give our self ideas that anything we do it possible when we put our mind it nothing can't stop us. For example we got our freedom from England long time ago, we ended slaves, and we ended racism which was big in the United State. Those are the reason why we can master things even if they are hard to master but we do it for a reason, and the reason is that we love to try new things even is bad but every challenge we are giving, we master them. But there is no dough we would failed those challenge that the world has giving us. Mastering is a challenge that is difficult because there is in our lifetime were we give up and we don't want it anymore. Were our mind and our body just doesn't want it, doesn't keep trying, at some point we start calling our selves looser, quitter.

We bring ourselves down because that how we punish ourselves without physical pain but emotion pain. In our life time that we have live in this earth the most pain that brought us down was emotional pain when we give up in life and we haven't master it. That is the big challenge that we haven't try to complete because it has beating us since the beginning that we are born we haven't control our emotion and that is the challenge that we haven't master it.

For that we have issues that we aren't able to figure it out because it's hard for us to figure what make us mad ,sad, happy, but people who has master it because they did give it a try and they successfully master that does emotions that give us hard time in life. Those people are therapy who want to understand does type emotion because they want to help those people who doesn't understand why they react like that.

That what make us to try new things in life because we are curious about what interest us as human being and see if can master it so ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered keep trying new thing that you would be able to do and get your attention to it "".",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0

expecially the praise come from their teacher, you know everyone like that other guys to praise him/her, i dont want to my parents criticize to me. even though common people, I care people's talk, Dosen't everybody care?

as a student, I understand that means in my mind, if I make some mistake, I know this is my fault early, when teacher criticize to me ,I will so sad, It isn't has a strong mind in everyone's heart, we are human not god, so don't bring blow to kid when he/ she get trouble. they are fragile, because they have different thought, more blame to others, more counter to you. you should try to encourge to them, say you are good, if student have some fault really, Don't say no ,should say:I think you can do it better.

It improtant to make progress when they are growing up. the great education is nurtured little by little early. I trust you can do it or blame them simply ,Let me compare and think about it. It's not in the same way.

You are distinctive! I really think that is truth. i admit you are right so long as you can say you understand by use your way. actually right or wrong is not improtant. but this is serious that you want to probe the problem of the learn is necessary, we can't blow them.

90E5BB6CBE11,"I personally think that student should chose there on summer projects because is not going to be as much fun if a teacher choose it. I dont think students are going to do there summer project if is something boring. If student do something there interesting on they are going to do research and finish there project on time because went summer hits not many student are interesting on doing work. I think that is going to be fun doing something i like and not something the teacher wants us to do.

If student do a summer project about just studient animals look for there behavior, some student mite think is fun. They would be some student that is going to be boring or they won't go out as much and not see animals at all. I think student should just pick the topic they think is going to be fun for them and they are going to enjoy reaching about whatever they want to learn. Teacher can grade something interesting not some boring work they tell us to do. i think even the teacher can have fun reading all the thing we come up with in the summer is just going to be fun for student and teachers.

I think teacher would be even happier if student do something they are going to get the benefits of it maybe a student wants to learn about how to treat a open cut or how to save the world from pollution. That would be something interesting that a student can learn about and who knows it mite come in handy and same the world from pollution and treat open cuts because your mom or friends got a dip cut in the house or in school. I just think is a way to learn about something you want not what the school wants us to learn.

I think this is a good way to make all the students to learn something they enjoy doing. You are going to do a interesting project the you are going to like and is just fun to learn new things. you are going to learn even more by doing something fun.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.0,2.5

This is important because you don't need money to be happy in your life just live your life with people the make you feel good and don't try to make you feel sad or bad.

In your life Don't follow nobody and don't trust no one just your self. For example do somethiing the you like and you need think about the you are better the everyone because some people in this life are jealousy and something they can break you dream and you can not follow your dream because he say someting the make you sad or he do someting to you the you feel the with the thing the he did you can stop follow your dream. This is important because Don't live somebody also your life and don't make someone also control and tell you what you need to do with your life.

Everyday I

think about world can be if everyone are able or think to help the next youth. For example one day I was in Italy I was going to the super market with my dad and i think was my friend too with I don't know wherever, we going t obuy all the food the we need and when going to the register to pay what we buy I saw a guy try to buy a sandwich but he tell the register the only money the he have was $0.50 cent the sandwich was i think $2 then when i saw him turn the sandwich back to the register I take the sandwich and I buy for him, he was so happy and he tell me,"" My friend you make my day better"" i was so happy that day. This is important because you don't need spend a lot of money to make someone happy.

27E725D251A8,"Do you think people aways succeed without any challenge in their life?.

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right.

Some people sometimes decide to isolate because they cannot handle the pressure of this world being a human is not easy becasue sometimes you just feel that the comments that the people make about you are real, but everybody should be strong and be themselves,because we as humans we can do anything that we want to achieve our goals and never pay attention to those comments because we can show them who we really are.

Firts, desire a lot of people when they see someone that is doing great on their life, sometimes people don't like it, others ones start thinking on doing it becuase they know the this man/woman are there because they work hard, in this world nothing is easy to have unless you work so hard to get it but never try to be soemeone else and is not necessary to do things that you don't like because you are trying to be like one else not do the mistake the most important thing is that you are going to show to those people that did not believe in you that nothing is impossible even when this world if full of envy.

Second, confidence now people around the world what they see in a person is their appearance,clothes, shoes, etc, now people are like trying to be something that they are not to try to fit in this fake world, but you know there is where you realize that is wrong to be honest things don't matter what really matter is who you are you and what can you offer to this world that is trying to kick you out, but you start getting confidence and that is a big challenge to try be youse around people that don't see life the way you see it.

Third, success as the world give you hard times you start to be strong, sometimes you have to go through things ` that you start to think about giving up, but you quickly think that you are wrong that you are going to make it even if is impossible like the author says ""To be you yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplsiments.""

Some people have lose their confidence becuase they are trying to be something that they're not, people think that being fake is the best way to fit, i don't think like them i think that you should you be who you really are.

In a world where you have to fight to be yourself and don't get lost in the fantasy that the world offers you that is the greastest accomplisment. A lot of people might argue that is not true, but they are all wrong because people always can be themselve if they wants even is the world if full of lies is their responsability to make real their dreams.

In the future i will try to tell the people that nothing is imposible, to not be afraid of who they are that each person if different in that is what make us special.

In this life you just have to be youlself enjoy every moment because after you get old you will regret everything that you didn't because you just were to be busy trying to be someone you are not.

No matter how old you are being hounst is a very good thing for kids, adualts and teenagers. I think you should be hounst at all times because if you'er not hounst people wont trust you, and people can come to you for advice, it also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst.

If you are not hounst people wont trust you. Most people want to be trusted. People want to be trusted in a relationship, friendship and a parentship and most importantly you would want to be trusted in your family. Being hounst whould make people trust in you in many ways. However, you can be trusted be not lieing or makeing fake roumers. For example a girl in our school whould make up roumers and lie about an eight th grader. Therefore, after doing all that no one wanted to be her friend because they could'nt trust her.

If you are hounst at all time people can come to you for advice. If your hounst your friends, sisters, classmates will come to you for advice because they would know you would have great ones. Mostimportantly they would trust you because you'er hounst and they will tell you everything and ask for advice and you will tell them what sounds good and hounst .Therefore, if you hounst you can be trusted by good advice that might actully help that person.

Being hounst also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst. Having trust issues can com from being dishounst and if you'er dishounst with someone it really makes that person think that they can't trust anyone at all. Thats because they have been broke by that other person who keeps lieing. That shows me that being hounst is an amazing thing that everyone chould have.

In summary being hounst is good for everyone .It could be hard for some people but you always have to remember you have to be hounst so, people could trust you, people could come to you for advice, it helps people with trust issues know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5

Being inactive can lead to health benefits, and also your not helping yourself in life, also there is no purpose. If not being active can lead to an unsuccessful life. Just being inactive is bad in general but people do have opinions on about it. Some people like to stay inside, not get a job, dropout of school, and fisk of having a unhealty body.

D250DB9080E0,"I agree with this prompt about the first impression, based on my own experience and for what I've seen in myself is related or better said similar on my every day life, and what I really mean by that is: First impression that we show it won't change that easy as many people expect to change between one month to a year, not because we couldn't change it but because this is who we are, also because this is how we act and it won't change because is part of ourselves.

In addition to this prompt i think it might be impossible to change our first impression not because we can't change it, but it'll be because is part of our personalities, in my case should I say is part of how I really am, how my culture distinguish me, that's what makes me unic and by trying to change a part of me it would make me feel empty, because first impression means a lot to me and is all thanks to my past experiences that I've been through.

In conclusion to this paragraph i think that first impression is important, it helps you to understand how a person is, also it helps you to analyze that one person, and most of all i think it helps a lot when you're patient when trying to understand others at the first time, sometimes or most of the time people would judge others by their first impression without seeing what's really their intention, this is what I think about it, we shouldn't judge just by the first time you meet someone even if you think that person is an stranger, just give them a change to prove you're wrong with their actions and their way to treat people, thank you.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success.

You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you don't study yourself at something you failed at, then you can't become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that won't happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice.

Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didn't feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then don't worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and can't move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past.

Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you won't reach to the top to become successful. For example, you can't swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont won't to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up.

In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.5
34E4FB64EEBA,"Don't you think that we should be what we are no matter who is around?

Is important that we give or have our own opinion. For me, my opinion is always important because is what it makes me unique, and what I think is that I know that some people is afraid to be what they are. Because they are afraid to the reaction of people that they love, for example the most important person in my life is my mom and she is the center of my life, like my dad... But you know something? I'm nervous about the reaction of them, if I act like I want, If I dress the way I like it, I'm afraid that my family or my friends judge me.

I think that the author ""Ralph Waldo Emerson"", is right. I'm agree with the Idea that he have about the world.

People around us is just looking for something to talk about and if for example, I do something wrong, the friends of my mom will talk about me and in a worst case, my mom will do the same. The world influence a lot in ourself in many ways for example:

You will see people following what other person say if he move to one side he or she will do the same.

When we are little people influence, tellling you to do the same that the other kid is doing. In some schools they don't let you to use imagination, like, you have to do what is there and in my opinion the kids should be free to write or draw what they want. I think that it will help to develop our ideas and be succesful.

Mom always is telling you to be like him or she. That she wish this and that and we are tryinng to do those things and be like they want, that we forget about us and we try to be someone else.

We have many expectations about what we can be, how many things can we accomplish, we make many questions to ourself and we try to be someone that is not us, just to make happy the rest of the people, when we should be looking for our own happiness, life is short, life is now and we have to be what it makes us happy, life doesn't make sense if we live in a place or have people around us that is just stealing our happiness. The world is big and is true that influences, even in our decisions. We have the choice to be what we want. Is our decision, is our opinion, is important to be what we are and not what they want.

There is some people that is not agree with this idea. They think that the world is not trying to make you someone else, that there is not any influence and be what the other people tell you to be, that the opinion don't affect and it shouldn't have any problem to act or be what they want. But, I think that people around us can influence in our decisions, because we don't want that people we love get upset about us. We are always worried about the opinions of the rest and that is a big example of how the world influence about us and in our personality.

We all have have something that it makes us unique and special of be. Everybody have different opinions, and there are some people that want others to follow what they said and is not the way it works. The world have many of good things and bad things but what will happen if we just follow what they said, people that is guiding is thinking that it will have the same or better results, but no, we have different results to the differents situations and that's why is important to be what we are and do what we like, because in that way, we know how to act to the situation and if will be a good thing for us to follow, is very important that we show ourself and get courage to confront many difficult situations.

F95CE6B81C75,"It is important to accomplish something in the future because it will help you find your dream job, It is one of your top hobbies and it will guide you to your strength.

To begin, you need to accomplish something you are struggling with in order to find your dream job. One thing you can accomplish is something that is school related. In fact, when I was in 4th grade disliked art class even when my sister said it was fun and easy I would just refuse everything that is related to art. In 5th grade as a student I was required to take art class and I thought that it would boring to be in a art class. In the middle of 5th grade I actually changed my mind about art class, sooner or later I found out that art class was something that I wanted to finish. Ever since 5th grade my mood for art class grew to be one of my likings. As a 8th grader now I am still taking art class and it is actually really enjoyable to be in art.

Secondly, it will help you find your hobby and your needs. Another thing you can do to accomplish something like English class or even just school in general is trying your best. Even when you think you can just skip it, you will somehow come back to it. In fact, when I was in 6th grade my grades were A's and C's one class however was an F, that class was English class. I didn't do my homework for English class and rejected help from the English teacher. In the beginning of 7th grade that same subject was getting harder and my grade for English decreased. At the middle of marking period 3 I decided that I had to do the classwork so I can create a new habit of trying to do work. I soon found out when I was trying to complete my missing work there was one assignment that caught my eye, That assignment was a book report that was supposed to be written. I tried the book report and soon I realized that I loved writing.

Lastly, completing something that is a challenge for you will help you find your strength in a certain subject and finding your strength will help you graduate. In fact, when I accomplished art class in 5th grade I found out that art was one of my strengths that was I only needed to try. I also found out that writing was something that could help me graduate and get me to my find one of my two careers. Art class helped me learn that I am actually really creative and helped me figure out that art was something that relieved my stress when it comes to school. English class helped me figure out that writing was one of my strengths and it will help me figure out my main career.

In conclusion, if you accomplish something like your challenges it would incourage you to find your dream job, Help you find one of your hobbies, and will support you to graduate.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
FF190BD8380B,"My grandma always said, "" Is ok to fail, the only thing that matters is to stand up and keep trying."" A decision is the act of deciding something, as a controversy or question, by reaching a conclusion or making a judgment. If people take their own decisions, they are going to benefit. People should take their own decisions because it is a right, people can learn for the consequences of their actions, and people have the ability to think by themselves.

Many argue that people should visit a guidance to take decisions because guidance may have more experiences solving problems. However, they are wrong because in the past people fight and die for rights, and now that everyone have the privilege to talk for themselves they are not going to let others to decide for them. Clearly, people do not need to visit a guidance in order to made a good decision.

Initially, citizens have the right to take their own decision. For instance, Generic_Name, who is a citizen of the United States, wants to get the divorce because he found his wife cheating on him. To specify, he went to the court to get the paperwork done for the divorce. To detail, he have the right and the privilege to get the divorce because it is human right; he do not need the help of any guidance to made this decision because is something too personal. One should observe that taking decisions is a right that everyone is able to reach.

Additionally, people can make mistakes, but they have the capacity to emend them. For example, Generic_Name, for peer pressure, take a wrong decision about using drugs. To add, she realize that what she did were a wrong decision, and she understood that is bad for her health and she staunch doing it. Clearly, society can make people do what they do not want, but is in one to say: no; and fix what they did wrong.

Last, but not less important, everyone have different ideas and points of views, and because of that people should make their own decisions. For instance, Generic_Name's parents teach him to differentiate between good and bad; that means that he is not going to be in troubles for a bad decisions. To illustrate, he do not need the help of others to make a good choice. Obviously, humans are unique and sometimes people do not going to agree with others, but that does not means that one is wrong and the other is right; people need to respect others decisions.

In summary, taking decisions is a privilege that ancestors gave us, people are going to made mistakes in order to success, and everyone is qualify to talk by themselves. These prove that citizens should not need to see a guidance in order to made decisions. People must respect others points of views and do not judge them for what they do. There is only one choice: respect and always have present that no matter what others said you can do it!",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

1F28812EE23D,"This assay is going to be about a thing that some businesses are doing which is to make a four day work week adding two hours to the regular work days. This essay will have my opinion if we should implement this idea in my school or not. I will talk about some advantages and disadvantages about the implement of this idea to my school. I will suggest some action that a shool should take before the implementing of this idea of this idea.

Imagine that you recieve a letter from your school saying that they are planning implement and idea which is to make students come to school four days instead of five adding two hours to the normal day of school. I disagree with this idea because it will affect my school which is a high school, instead of helping it. The first thing that will be affected will be the after school program and activities. If my school add two hours to our schedule each day will consist in ten hours, so students will be more tired and less student will be interest in involving in after school programs so the school might cancel them. I would said that it will affect a high school especially because there are a lot of juniors and siniors that work after school and it can cause to most of them to quit their jobs.

Implementing this idea to our school have some advantages and disadvantages as well. One advantage of adding two hours to our schedule are that we will have more time to do our work in school because classes should be longer. Another advantage is that this idea help to conserve energy and resources of the school. A disadvantage is that after school programs might be closed because not so many people will be interested in that. The other disadvantage is that some students might have to change their jobs hour which is not easy and some of them would have to opt for quiting their jobs.

Before adding this idea to my school or any school they should ake some actions before. First the school staff should make a meeting to discuss the idea. Then they should make another meeting but this time including the parents of the students. In which they explain to them in what the idea consist. Next they should send a letter home in which the idea is well explained but this time parents have to sign the letter and say wether they agree to the implement of the idea or desagree. Finally after doing all this now the school can decide wether the idea is being implemented or no.

In conclusion I disagree with implementing this idea to my school because it will affect the school instead of helping it. I would say that this idea have a lot of desadvantages too. For example the school might cancel after school activities, some students might lose their jobs, and we will get home more tired. I think that the schedule thath my school have right now is just great because students play sports, participate in after school programs, and some others can work too. I think that my school should not implement this idea because we are fine with the schedule that we have and adding two hours will just affect us instead of being beneficial.

92F7DD653EFB,"Some people think that is more beneficial working alone that working in group. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. I feel that the benefits come from others.

The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits.

It's obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.",4.0,3.0,3.5,2.0,3.0,3.0
2EEB160A4BD1,"85% of people think that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has been said that people who have a great attitude have more opportunity to sucess in life than people who have a negative attitude. However, some people may think that a good attitude is not always necessary because there are job that doesn't required a positive attitude. Having a good attitude can help you to find a job, make new friends and help you to archieve your goals.

For example, it can help you to find a job and if your job required to comunicate with others people your attitude will make people to like you, also your manager will like how you work and how you treat the costumers. Furthermore, your attitude can make you the best employer in your job and help you to find a better job.

In addition, a good attitude can make you find new friends and they will always want to talk to you or be all the time with you even if they don't feel good they know you can make them happy because you have a positive attitude that they like. More over, you could only have friends that have a great attitude like yours because people that have a negative attitude would not like to have you as a friend because you are always happy.

To archieve your goals you may need to have a good attitude because when you don't feel good and you don't want to continue trying your attitude will help you to never give up and continue trying until you archieve your goals. When I don't want to continue in high school and I just want to get a job I like to have a good attitude and think about my goals and how far I'm right now and that help me to make me happy and to not give up.

In other words, your attitude is really important in your life not everyone has a good attitude and not everyone think that attitude is important, but a great attitude can help you with many things like to make good decisions, to be a better person, and to make people love you.

I agree with having the normal school week because, The majorly of the high school students have part times jobs they work after school and having a nine hours school day would not leave enough time for students to work in a part time job, There are some girls at high school that have babies, and they are paying babysits, with a nine hours school days moms would spend less time with their babies and they would have to pay more hours to babysits, With an nine hours school day the amount of time to study, do homework or prepare for projects would be less then a normal school day of seven hours that can affects students grade.

7C2650EEA2B6,"Do you think a three month break is too long ? Some professors feel that summer break is too long and students are most likely to forget everything they have learned when they return to school. However, both professors and students deserve a nice, long break because ten months of high school can cause tons of stress, people get to spend more time with their families, and last but not least, students can take classes during the summer if they want to graduate early.

First, most students want to attend to good colleges, therefore, they take advanced classes in high school in order to receive more credits. Teachers give more assignments in advanced classes and the work is much harder than course classes. Students often have to stay up late to finish school work. In addition, with little amount of sleep can cause students serious stress. For instance, my cousin once took six college classes in her junior year of high school. She never had much time to eat nor sleep, to the point where she passed out. My family had to take her to the doctors for a checkup. They said that she had stress issue and it may take a long time for her to recover. Luckily, with three months of summer break, she became better.

Second, some students don't want to spend four years in high school when they have an opportunity to graduate early. In order to do so, they must take all of the requirement courses. Though, not all courses are available during the school year, however, students can take it in the summer. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, took English 11 over the last summer, so she could graduate early from high school and soon become a nurse. She learned everything she needed for the tests within two months of summer school,

Third, many people love to spend time with their families. Summer break would be an awesome opportunity for both teachers and students to go on vacations with their loved ones. They can travel to different states or even countries if they like. In the summer of 2015, my family and I had a great time in Generic_City. I got to experience many amazing things, it was the best summer I have ever had. Though, the most wonderful time of the year is summer, however, some argue that there should be year round schools and only three to four weeks of break in the summer.

In conclusion, all students and teachers, including staff members deserve a nice, long summer break. Most people agree that school is very stressful, therefore, a three month break is not too long. Some says that when one is stress out, they can't think nor do things well. On the other hand, when their mind is relax they will achieve successful things in life. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5

As may many people say that the negative attitude is way to succeed, however, a positive attitude, explain the performances of your doing for example Generic_Name got 50 out of 100, which she wanted on her presentation not because she did not do the work properly,but because the way she present her presentation and she was scared and nervous to present it in front of everyone. It was majorly graded on her performance, but next time she practiced her way to present her presentation five-six times and thought about how she can do this and she doesn't have to be scared of anything and she got 100 on it, which was her goal.

It shows the optimistic behavior of human supports during their task.

Your past always reflects on your future. Everyone learns something from their mistakes or good memories.

In my opinion attitude should be always positive, because it can help you to succeed in work, can encourage people to do their best, even if what they have to do is hard to do it, and it can be a great tool in order to succeed in relationships, and believed in yourself.

When I was working in Mango Paradise, my boss was a really bitter person, that was always angry with everyone in the work, but I was one person that I didn't care about his bad attitude toward us, I was always with a big smile, perhap how he treated us. There was one day that he had a bad day, because one member of his family was in the hospital, and was very delicate, he was an a mood that did not look like he was the same one, he was sad, he was devastated, and worried, because the person that was in the hospital was his wife, she had cancer. So, that same day I asked him if we may talk, he said "" Yes"", I just wanted to talk with him and tell him that perhap everything, we were there to support him in everything he needed. Unfortunate, his wife pass away, and as I said to him, we were there all the time supporting him, we were there with a positive attitude telling him, that everything will be okay, that his wife is gonna be in a better place where can rest in peace, where she will not suffer more. He was so thankful with us because how we supported him in that bad moments that wanted to increase our salary, many of us accepted, but many others not. He really change since that days, that many of us, we are still working there, and earning more money than we regurlarly earned.

In every human life, there is always a hard problem, that make us to give up, but there is also a person with a positive attitude that makes us to get up, and continue with our life. There was a time in my family where we had a problem of money, my father got fired on his work, we almost lose the house where we were living, because we did not paid the rent in almost four months. My father was devastated, he was looking for a job amost for three months, and he could not find any job to pay the rent, so we would not lose the house. As every wife do, my mom came to him and said ""Do not worry sweetheart, we can get out of this problem as we always do, I am here to support you"". My father almost immediately changed his attitude, he gave to my mom a big smile and said to her "" Thanks babe to be always with me, and for trust on me"", he get up take the keys of the car, and went out to look for another job. He found a new job where he earn a little bit more than his previous job, so our money's problem disappear.

Believe in yourself not always is easy, some times we though that is difficult to understand yourself, but there is always a lovely person that help you to believed in how strong you are, and to see all the thing that you are capable to do. When I was in 10 grade, I had an algebra teacher that was always telling us that we had to believed more in ourselves, sometimes we did not do what she asked us to do, because we did not understand, many of us were disappointed of ourselves, because we didn't even try to do it. In the first quater many of us in our class period failed. We though that our score would never change. After that many student changed their attitude, but it was not because we wanted. It was because our teacher talked with us, and made us to believe that we can do anything that we want to do. Some time later many of us had changed, as we changed, we saw that our teacher changed too. The second quater passed, and the students were happy because their score in the algebra class, many students's score were from 50 to 90, it happened because all us changed our attitude in different manners. We paid more attention as we should since the beginning of the year, we started to believe in us, we started to do things even if we didn't know how to do it. Until this moment I am thankful with my teacher, because of her, we changed to a better score, because of her we believe more in ourselves, she just wanted our best, but sometimes we made her get angry, because we did not believed in ourselves. We changed, all of us did, and she became for me the most good person as a teacher and as a friend, she was always supporting us, and teaching us. That is why until this moment she is one of my favorite teacher, and I think that for my other classmates she is too. For that experience that I had, I think that possitive attitude is something extremely important in every human life.

Our attitude has to be always positive, even in the worst moment of our life.

Some people think that a person should have a positive attitude just during a very important moment, or in happy moments, this is not correct, they all are wrong, we need to have a possitive attitude always in order to succeed in life, and to be happy. In our homes old people as grandmother, grandfather, sibblings and parents, need to give the example, so kids will take it, and they will be confident and a positive person.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5

My point of view is that we all have choice's we make to better our selves to make us better people in the world but some of the choice's we make as human's can lead us to a wrong path. We as people have to set goal's for the future and plan ahead to accomplish them. One thing i learn while being incarcerated you got to value yourself more than you value other's, if you dont value yourself what's the point for setting up goal's if all they going to do is collect dust.

Everybody haves different opinion's some people might think the world is at fault for the choice's they make and thats not true, people blame others when they know their in the wrong or done something wrong than try to say it's the other person's fault. I'll say is, with everything going on in the world we got to get together and help each other more and come together as a team NO! more as a family, when one of us fall down we lift each other up, if one of us get's hurt we heal each other. There's got to be thing's we can do, hard time's dont last forever at these moment's we got to remember how far we come from hard time's when things didnt look good for us.

If you are afraid of highs you can go and Skydive with your friends or one of your family members. When your are up in the sky you get to see trees,grass and other stuff from far away. I think it would be fun because you get to fly in the sky. If you Skydive you can see animals that you never saw in your entire life. You can also maybe see weird stuff that you never saw. You can see a dog,cat or small houses and tiny people. If you Skydive i think you would fine a lot of different kind of things in the air. If you were to scared to go on a roller coaster. You can go on a roller coaster now because you jumped off an airplane. And If you were to scared to go airplane because it was to high. Now you can go on a airplane and travel because you wouldn't be scared to be that high and where you jumped from the airplane. The airplane is going to be the same hight. I think you won't have fears of heights anymore and you would like to travel a lot. You can go to places that you can't go with a car. Like bora bora or the other tropical places. Skydiving can be a lot of fun but it can also be very dangerous. If you don't know any thing like how to turn on the air bag for you to float you could fall when you land. If you don't know how to land you could hurt yourself or land somewhere else. If you don't feel safe i think you should go to the indoor one first. After all, Skydiving can make you see weird stuff that you never seen before and you can face your fears by going on an airplane or riding on a roller coaster. I think one day you should go skydiving and see every thing that you can see. If you are scared of highs like mountains or going on high stuff. I think it is going to help you but if you think you are not going to know what to do for the air bag. I think you should go to the indoor one first. If you want to go to the outside one someone is going to be on top of you and they are going to be doing the air bag and the landing. You are just going to be flying with them and you don't have to worry about anything you can just see the view and see if you see anything interesting that you never seen before.",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
EF5B4AE52BE6,"In some societies, some students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The courses of study in High School are selected to guide them toward a specific career. It would be amazing if students start when they enter High School. It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Students should be commit to a career at a young age because it helps students to develop more and it allows a lot of opportunity for many students.

First, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it would helps to develop more. For example, sometimes students choose to do other stuff instead do work. Some students really want to success and get everything in life. Students would always like to have good future over everything. If students commit to a career at a young age, they would be develop in different ways. For example, students would have more stuff to do, more homework. Their mind would be thinking about stuff for their careers. They going to take things more serious for their life.

Secondly, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it allows a lot of opportunity. For example, Generic_Name was a student from Generic_school, she choose to start commit to a career when she was 17 years old. It was hard for her because she took a lot of extra classes. But, she planned to get better lifestyle. She work really hard to complete what she want. By, Generic_Name start a career at a young age was the best option she did in her life, she have a lot of opportunity, she can work wherever she want to. Thus, start thing at a young age students would success more.

However, some people may argue that students should not be commit to a career at a young age because students would not enjoy High School. For example, people argue that students would be more incline about their career, and the would not enjoy High School as a teenager. However, start at a young age would be benefit for students because they would take High School as serious part of life. Also, students would have more opportunity in life, and they would develop more as a person.

To conclude, people would always say that students should no be start a career at a young age. But start at a young age would be the best choice for students in life. Students have the opportunity to be more successful in their careers. Sometimes would be hard for them to do double work, but as they focus and work hard, they would complete a lot in life. Start things at a young age always have good benefits for students and people in general.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
4E13812BC1ED,"Meet new people and make new friends is fun. Having social relationships; is a good way to have a good community. Always, when we see new people that we are about to meet, we have first impressions- ideas, feelings or opinions about a person based on the superficial. For some people, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, I disagree with this statement, because this can change by: introducing each other, know more about favorite things, and ask questions about their life, then our first impressions will change.

When a person is about to meet another person, they act differently as they are in their daily life, which is totally fine, because they are going to introduce each other and it will change. One day, when I was in my freshman year, I was really nervous and exciting at the same time, and this because I did not know anyone at the school, but I meet one girl; she was really kind and friendly. So, we introduce each other, and my first impression before introduce each other was, that she was serious and shy. The importance of this, is that our first impression can change after introducing each other, because we can have an idea of how the person is, based on their look or way to act, but this idea can be totally different after cross a few words each other.

Furthermore, a good way to change our impression is knowing more about the other person, know about their favorite things such as hobbies, sports, and others; putting this in practice it can change the way of thinking of both persons. In my way of thinking about the impressions, these can be bad or good impressions, and a personality is part of the impression because it shows the behavior of a people. So, it is important to know more about the person; about their personality and by this could have a clue about the personality of the person.

Finally, different person has a something important in their life, and that is what makes special to a person. For example, all my friends before they know me, they think that I look shy, calm and serious before they know me, but time later these impressions change for them. They told me now ""when we saw you for the first time, we though that you was so quite and serious"". And they said this, because they know more about me and about my life now, and they think that I am a fun friend and happy, so this is what makes me special, that I always look serious, but when the people know me, they think that I am friendly and happy. And I think that always, when we see a person that we never seem before, we should think to ask about their life, because details about their life can help us to change our way of view and think about the person.

Therefore, first impressions can change, they are not always accurate in the way of how the behavior of the people can be. We could think that people are as the way of their physical appearance, but that is completely wrong. In order to meet new people, we have to introduce each other, know more about them, and ask questions about their life, then we can have a clearly personality about the person. After this, our impressions would change to a positive or negative impressions. We should not trust in our first impressions about a person, we should meet the person and our first impressions will change. ",4.0,2.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

Well its important to help the community service because if we don't our city might be dirty and not clean and sometimes our city is very dirty cause some people just throw trush in the floor and that's why we always have to keep our city clean so we don't have to have our city dirty. Sometimes my friends don't like helping the community service because she doesn't care but i tell her its important to help the community because if we don't we just might not have water, food, etc. When my OTHER_NAME was here in LOCATION_NAME she sometimes take me to the park and pick up trash from the floor and throw it on the trash can or sometimes she takes me to go and check in the trash can to see if there is cans so we could recycle it.

After when me and my OTHER_NAME was at the park picking up the trash we saw these two guys that were throwing food on the floor and I told my OTHER_NAME look those guys are throwing food on the floor so when they left I went and picked up what they threw on the floor cause its important to help the community service. Also sometimes I go to LOCATION_NAME and there is a lot of trash on the floor and when I always go over there with my cousin I always take a bag so i could pick up the trash and food that they have on the floor.

Finally I really like helping the community service because i just really like picking up the cans that are in the floor and go recycle it. Finally the last thing im goin to tell you is that you should tell all the kids from the school that its important to help the community service I love it..

12FE853D6B88,"I agree with Emerson's statement because people should be themselves no matter what. You want to always show the real you. That is the beuty of life,connecting with different types of people with different types of personalitys. People in this world now a days are cruel and mean that have no heart. People bully others because of theres clothes,shoes, and how they look. You can get bullied for anything now a days, its very sad. That's why people who get bullied hate themselves and want to become something they are not.

I remember one point in my life, i was deppressed. I kept getting bullied because of how big my head was or how skinny i was. I know it sounds funny, i laugh all the time when i talk about it dont worry. I stopped wanting to come to school because of that. I never wanted to leave my house or talk to anyone. It was very sad. But one day one of my close friends asked me why i wasn't coming to school, and i told him everything. He told me straight up to ignore all the negative stuff that people call me and live your life to the fullest. Since that day, we have been bros for life. He always had my back and i always had his. A few weeks passed and i told my mother. We talked for a few hours about how i should ignore all the negative stuff because life is so short that you can't let anything stop you. That really changed me and how i see life.

Trying to be yourself in this world is very difficult now a days. Just by telling someone that there shoes are ugly can really change the whole person. They start buying stuff that they don't really like. Also doing stuff they don't want to do. Suddenly they start doing bad stuff. Just to fit in with other people that have all the nice clothes and shoes etc. People really can't be themselves because of judgment.

There should be more help in this world so people that are going through this can get help. People should be motivated to be themselves and also love themselves. Some people can really say somethig mean and the victim could commite suicide, just because of someones judgment. People should start treating other people with respect. Parents should start teaching there kids early on how to show respect. People shouldn't care about someone elses opinion. People should live there lifes to the fullest.

People should feel very accomplished to be themselves in this world. People really make you feel like trash when they say something negative about you. There is always going to be negative stuff coming at you, that's normal. That is what makes you stronger and turns you into a great human being.

But some people think that positive attitude is not that much important. It's important because they can make positive decisions, they people around them on work place will be good with them, and student with positive attitude can be respect full with their teachers and other students.

First of all, people with a positive attitude can make a positive decisions on their life. Because, if a person have positive thought and attitude they can good think and they can decided to have convention with good people. And every parents wants to teach their child to have good attitude with everyone, and they wants to their child respect them. And everyone like mother, father, brother, sister, friends will proud on them.

no matter where you are going, which communication you life, just be a positive with people and with yourself it will success you.

Moreover, the people around them on the work place will be good with them. Because everyone likes to be with a person that has a good and positive attitude. And to being good with each others. A person can have a good attitude and respect with people whom work with them. And you can save you job by being good and positive. If you work some where and you have bed attitude no body will loves you and they will never want to conversion with you. Being positive on work place.

finally, students with their positive attitude can be respect full with their teachers and other students. And also teachers will help and support them a lot. And students also learn in school to have positive attitude and teacher always telling to students if they have a negatives attitude, whats doing to happen with and if they have positives attitude, whats going to happen whit them. student by having negative attitude, they will lose everything on their life. just try to be positive by doing positive thing you will feel good.

6C86103B510D,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. The actions as words are powerful over another's person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are.

I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. People follow others because they like the other person's personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media.

Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow.

I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone else's life there is nothing better than our own behavior. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. In my opinion people's actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others.

Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do.

If the student is expected to identify a career by highschool it can affect how their doing in school becuse all they will be thinking about is a career to pick.

Others might argue that a student who has a career in mind by the time they enter highschool will succesed because they know what they want to do in life.

FF13996AB0B3,"Although some say schools shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students would not get enough educations away from school, actually students should have benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

However, some say school shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldn't get enough knowledge at home, it's better in school.

Actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students don't understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didn't know who he was at first, and I found his history in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google.

Second, video conferencing is helpful. There is a website called Edubirdie. This website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc.. Also, I remembered when I had a final exam for chemistry, and the problem was I didn't learned anything from chemistry class. Because my teacher was horrible, I didn't learned anything from him. So, I searched to Edubirdie website and watched some videos of stochiometry problem and word problems. Then, I face timed a Chemistry teacher from Edubirdie. I spend like 10 hours with her. It helped me little bit. After that, I took the final exam and I barely passed the class with the D+. at least I passed the class and I'm happy with it.

F7DC6C783239,"Bad choices, no better career. Ever thought about how a bad path looks like? A bad path will never lead you into good things. It will just mess up your school grades. Think about the good choices and how it will bring joy into your life.

First, my cousin was going through a bad path last year when he was a freshman in high school. He would always come home late at night. He always had his mother worried about him. Next, there was this one night where she was so worried, she had to call the police because she thought something bad happened to him. When my mom told me about the situation, I never looked up to it, never imagined myself doing that. In addition, he would barely answer his mothers phone calls. She was devastated seeing her son go through a bad path. One day she was done with the things he did, so she decided to take him to Generic_City with my 37 year old cousin. He spent about 2 weeks in Generic_City so that he would think about his bad choices. When he came back, his mother decided to move to another house and another school for him. Finally, things are so much better now. His grades are much better now, he doesn't go out to late at night anymore, and his mom is peacefully working.

My cousin is doing good choices now. First, he is not in bad paths anymore thanks to his mother. Recently, he has been working out and eating healthy. Every Saturdays and Sundays morning, he goes to the gym with this older sister that is 21 years old. Next, he gets home he eats a bowl of sugar free oatmeal with sliced strawberries and blueberries. I know for sure that he wants to be a new and better person. Last year when he was a freshman, he would skip a lot of school days. His mother would get phone calls of him absent. But, he is putting a lot of effort into school. Over the summer, my dad decided to take him to work with him. My cousin helped him out with construction tools. They both worked for about 7 hours that day. A few days later, my dad had to meet up with his boss and other co-workers to earn the money. Lastly, my dad, siblings and I drove to his house to not only drop off the 80 dollars he earned, but also see how him and his family were doing.

I never experienced this, and I know that I never will. Seeing the suffer in his mom was terrifying. I would never want my mother to suffer the way his mother did.

Having to take those classes just adds classes you need to graduate. It is also all a waist of time if the students are not actually in to it.

Firstly, these classes are just extra classes that we dont really need. In my opnion, I believe that student should be able to graduate highschool with the classes they need. English, Math, History and Science are all classes that can support them when they go to college. If student don't take these classes they may also graduate ealier then they are supposed to. For example, I go to a highschool where I get the credits I need and I am able to graduate a year earlier. Which I think everyone should have the chance too.

Lastly, if a student is not interested in one of these classes they won't try. Even if they do try and fail then its just holding them back. They will start stressing over it when they won't actually end up needing it. Student will also consume most of their time bringing up their grade in these classes that they will not work on other classes. Then they will end up failing.

On the other hand, some might say these classes should be required because student might find interest in one of those and would like to persue it after graduating. I think that if a student is interested then they should be allowed to take the class of your choice. However, if your not then you should not be pushed to take them when you dont want to.

In conclusion, student should not be forced to take elcective classes. If they want to they should but if not then they shouldnt need it to graduate.

BBE8AE3B2B09,"- Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years?

In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn:

How to save up money for a better future

How to have a better behavior

You learn how to spell some stuff correctly

How to write essays

There is a lot that you must know before graduating. Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now. Basically my option is no, it is not a good idea to graduate early.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

7C5E4E2779BF,"I'm agree with Emerson's restatement, in my point of view or personality I can say that I want to be a different person with another qualities, create other ways to think how big or how much I can do to show to the world my authentic and proper knowledge, when I have to make a decision I don't have to think too much about it, I believe in what I'm doing. When you think to be a real person and someone different to the rest, you need to have a plan that consist step by step and develop that plan in the course of your life to make goals to short time and large period of time, be patient with each little detail that you want to do.

For example:

If yo want to do something that you think that is impossible for any reason, you don't have to leave that idea or goal that you have in mind, remember that all you need is work hard, be simple and don't complain for any problem or reason that tomorrow will have a lot of consequences.

At this time, the people and no one wants to see another person having their own goals or their dreams that they had when they were children. Every single person will try to impress to your attention to turn down your attitude and your positive life, I have too many experiences that I never want to pass that process again, in this world exist all type of people that want to help, to destroy your intention or the ways to see the real things, you're a guide and an example to change the format in this age. When you have a purpose that everyday make changes in your personal life or something like motivation to do anything that that have a great value to demonstrate to you family that they are the base to all of your goals have worth. A big percentage of people want to be rich, and my way to think about it, is that all thing that's material it doesn't have a real value for a great and humble person, the value is something that makes you having a great family, a simple life, because the world need to be protected by several and carefully people that are interesting in show another face to represent a different type of humanity.

Be an individual person is how you you can to do to confront the reality and give another perspective to make a great research in your your period of life to change or keep using that type of life and really cares about what are you doing with an specific and central idea.

I have a positive and big action to say that Emerson is right because nobody wants to be the shadow of any person or leave an opportunity that will make the life of one or more person to decide to experiment a new way to see the society and doing the correct process to be an excellent human with integrity and feeling of better life.

My conclusion for this restatement is that I want to be myself with great intentions to form an integrity in this society and have the best recognition to prove that it's possible to make and develop a proper identity with a new perspective to imagine and be the next person in the world that makes you a connection with your interior and have peace to concentrate in own goals that will converting on a genuine person to be autonomous of your acts, be someone responsible, charismatic and all of these characteristics define your personality it doesn't matter where yo come from or where you at, just be an example that if I can do this, you can do it better than me and better as you want.

Education can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. Entire generations have been based upon education. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the school's schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules.

Beginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their locker's present condition. Even at the end of the day they may be questioning what to do with their best friend while they both have separate projects due tomorrow. In essence, a student's day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone.

With the prolonging of the day present, multiple casual difficulties may be amplified whilst new forms of faults can be felt by many students. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension.

A final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences.

Faculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with.

Though a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. Homework can have a higher chance of being finished within school hours. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain.

As previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school.

Once again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly.

92EA64272FB4,"High school is like a preschool for young adults, where they get a chance to explore the world much earlier.

Students at grade nine through twelve get to learn what they want to be at a young age. It gets them more interested in the careers they choose in the nearest future. As they get through high school, they will know what path to take and what needs to get done. As soon as these young adults leave they won't have to stress of what their going to be. It's agreeable for students to start looking into their career at a young age.

Through out the years in High school, students will have the rights to choose their own courses, which follows up to their interest. For example: culinary arts, design multi media, masonry, and more. They can also choose any subjects such as: math, English, science, and history. These courses can also help those students with their future careers. While these students are learning they realize what they like and what they don't like. The upcoming goal for them by the time they leave high school is what they are going to become.

As these young adults think of what their going to be, they will think twice on some careers. Which gives them time to research options, and that research will reflect on which career is the best for them. While being young an thinking of a career students will have enough time to sort the ones the students like and the ones they dislike. The average life Span of a human is up to 75 years, which means 18 of those years can resolve of what the students are going to do when they grow up. Teen's can dream what they could be but can they put the effort in trying.

As in college, students will have to get credits to graduate high school, and need to pass a amount of exams.

From there the students path will flow to what college they'll go, when thinking young they got to think smart, which means they got to put the effort. When thinking of a career at a young age the students will have most of everything planned. Its never too much to notice that a student has more potential young than old because they got more time.

The students won't stress out because their not out in the world alone finding what to do.

Teens can commit to any career because they have had a whole lot of time to think of any career.

Its never bad for a kid to have dreams of being a cop and going for that career. Its always good to plan ahead, to always think and do. It's great that a young adult wants to think of it's future. Agreeing something that everybody has done, is something that people can agree on.     ",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
43AE9E4D0EFC,"I would say that I am agree because If you want a succesful life you have to learn how to made your life easy showing to the world that you are special that you can be a nice person does not matter what the other people said or think, you have to take everything with calm and if you have problems you have to solve it with a good attitude because if you get angry you do not going to solve in a good way that is why you have to be a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and the last but not least have a good connection with the people that are around you, you have to put a happy face to everything that comming directtly to you.

When you are a good person with all people you made them feel good and also you feel it, because when you are a goood person you are saying that you are different to everybody, because in this world we can see that alot of people are so bad but that does not mean that all of them are aqualsbut ypu do not have to stop being a nice person just because you know people that have a bad attitude, the only thing that you have to do is be away from all of them and give to yourself a chance to know that really think like you that can make you feel as in family, this people will make you feel better because you are showing to them that you can have people around you that can make you have a better life and also more succes, for example I am a good person with all people ,with my family, and with my friends; I am gonna told you something about my friends they are specil I love them and they love me you know why because I took my time to know them, now I know what they like or how they spend their time and the most important they think that I am a succes person that make have a good attitude with them and I want them in my life and I think they will have a a nice life because I see in them that they will be very succes people.

I think that have peace is a important part of your life, because from your soul you get a lot of good feelings that make you feel comfortable,but in the same way sometimes you can have something and that make you be incomfrotable but there is you have to try to have peace, I konw that can be so difficult, do not have peace inside of you can affect you in some ways in your life, I think that to feel peace you have to do things that really like you or find something that you can make always and is not bored and also not get angry so easy because just for one problem you can be mad for a weekend or more and that is not good for you there is anything better than have peace, when I was 12 my younger brother did something that do not like me in that timeand I still remember since the first day I can tell you is not good have that mind inside of me, I am 20 now and I think that mind is gonna be with me the my whole life, but I trying to do not remember but when I remember I tell to my self that I love my brother and we are so close and he is a person that is there to hear me and when I talk with with him I tell to him everything thatv is happening in my life I feel peace in my soul.

A good connection with people that are around you can help you to have a good attitude because if you meet people that always are positives or always talk about things that are going to help in your life they can influence in your future because they know what they want in their life or what is bad for them those people is nice to meet, are interesting to hear, you can learn somethings from them and you can share some ideas, but in ypur life you will know a lot of people maybe good or maybe bad some of them are going to be nice, they will ask you to go outside a lot of days or they will invate you to have fun and you will think that those people are the good for your to be succes, but let me tell you sometimes the good people are the ones that offert to you not a party if not something that can be good for your life something that is not going to affect your future , and I know sometimes you are going to feel that the people that want to help you are the bad ones but not you are wrong, I know a person that I saw a great future he studied with me, he always had good grades, he always did homeworks, he was a nice guy this happen in the sevent grade, but when we attend the nine grade he start to meet people that they had bad grades they di not do homeworks and I think they don not wanted a future, some months later his grades goes down but was because he always when I ask him where he was, he was going something bad with his new friends and then he turns to one of them , and I think he do not attend college, this is why I am saying to have a successful future you have to be with people that are going to help you in your future.

I think we all agree after this three points that were; a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and have a good connection with people that are around you, this make me think how important is have a good attitude, show a good attitude to everybody, and have a good attitude does not matter what is happening in your life.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0

B3AAF502DFFE,"In this generation people use Technology for their needs and wants. If their was no Technology than I would not be able to take my writing SOL which I am taking it right now. In my opinion I believe that the limitation of human contact due to the use of Technology had positive effects on people's lives.

People use Technology to complete many tasks through out their lives. If their was no Technology their would not be any improvement in our lives neither country. people can contact their family with video calls to see their families that they havent seen each other for years. It has been 7 years that I am living in United States of America and I cant go back to my country for various reasons, but I have been in contact with my family everyday, which makes me really happy, and feel good about it. Nowadays everyone need Technology for everything. My friend father is an engineer, and all his work is with computer, and Technology. If their was no Technology he wouldnt be able to complete his task or learn new things neither earn money.

Technology saves Millions of people lives in many ways. Many people do not have money to take tutorials for their kids, but they can use YouTube and Google which let them learn in a better way, and without paying any money. In fact even though if you had money you could save your money and use Technology/ Internet for learning. My parents never took me to any tutorials not because they didnt have money but because they wanted me to be independent and use Internet to learn more. Technology had helped me a lot, and will be helping me and millions of people in this world. I think in this Generation If their was no Technology people would not improve or even learn anything. I have learned from Internet that you can read books online instead of going and buying. Technology has let people gain education and experiences through our lives.

Their are thousands of disabilities in this world which they cant go and work, but they use Internet to sale some stuff so they can earn money. My cousin is a specialist and he was born with not having one of his leg. He was so depressed and didnt have any confident that one day he could work and earn money, but with the help of Internet I have thought him to buy some clothes and other stuff and put it online so people can see and buy it. Technology has lots of benefits that we humans are so lucky of being able of using it which some people cant, because of various reasons. It has been 3 years that we have opened our own clothing business in Unites States of America, and as we all know it's really hard competing with clothing stores here in USA, but from the time we started putting our clothes in websites and becoming popular day by day we are making lots of profits which makes us really happy. Technology has a positive effects in our lives which a lot of people agree with my opinion.

I agree with that, that Technology also had a negative effects in our lives , but also that depends on the person itself which decides how to use Technology. Most of my friends make fake accounts on Instagram and Facebook to bully people which a lot of people die from being bullied. Technology has a lot of advantages and disadvantages that we can use form it. Some people's use Internet for watching bad videos, making fake accounts and put putting fake news on websites and hacking people through social media which are really bad, but their are only 5% that they do those things, and not everyone which we should think of the other 95% of using Technology for their needs, and the benefits of gaining lots of education.

In my perspective I believe that the use of Technology has positive effects on people lives, because we human are earning money out of Technology, learning new things, and gaining experiences in our lives with the help of of Technology. I think their should be a way of blocking the bad websites and making securities for people making fake accounts and for people that bully others to stop it. In my opinion we should think about the benefits of Technology than the negatives because. If their was no Technology our lives would never improve and we would not be able to learn new things. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contacts with each other. My dad has been in Generic_City for 30 years and his job is sailing Fabrics and all his customers are from Generic_City, Generic_City ,and Generic_City which they have never been in Generic_City. They have founded our sites through online, and buy from us. My dad has never seen most of his customers in real lives they only have been in contact. We should look at Technology from a good point of view.

In General we have variety of reasons that we could use technology of our tasks to be completed. Technology could be good and bad in both ways which we human should decide of how to use it either of our needs or for negative things. I believe that technology has had positive effects on people lives.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,2.5,3.5

Well do you agree with me because I do think you should be honest.

Well sometimes it is not good to be truthful because some people are crazy humans in this world. You should always be honest to your family. They appreciate you more than anything. I think being honest will always be great think for this generation. The benefit of being honest at all times because your friends will know your trustworthy,parents love that more than anything,and you're not a lair.

My first reason is your friends have more trust in you. They will have a better friendship most likely. Friends will buy things for you like shoes,shirts,and shorts. Some times friends don't like that much honest because they might feel sad and stress out like when my sister came back from Generic_City from college. My sister friend was honest but my sister felt sad because it was heartbreaking to her. But any away my sister is find now living her best live. Your friends will dislike your honesty and like your honesty. They might tell you secrets that they never told there parents.

Another reason is parents love you more if your honest in my opinion. They care for more than anything. They gave you a life. Even if your friend said something very bad you should tell them anyways because they will probably help your friend that is need of help. They love you more than anything. Being honest to your mom and dad are the most. In the past I will always lie and you can picture the next thing. Sometimes parents hate when there child tells everything to there cousin,and which my mom hates children .

My last reason is your not gonna be a liar if you become honest at all time. In my religion if you are liar or not honest at anytime you are a liar. God will forgive you if you ask forgiveness. You will have better life and future. I sometimes like being honest because adults like hearing the truths and I wanna be that kind of kid. I like being that good kid and quite kid that loves being friends from a long time ago. I hate when people lie than walk and they try to be honest. Sometimes people I think should not lie and e honest.

In conclusion, the benefit of being honest at all time because is great for you. I think being great will make your family great as well as people around you. I think friends will love you more than anything. You are a great human being as like your parents. I think having a wonerful time being great person. As being honest everybody esle will be honest. Some honesty is bad for other friends are cool with it. God will forgive you as well as your parents. The honest person will always win.

In my position i agree with the statement, because; people get better communication with others, get more jobs, and students have more opportunities.

Some people think attitude reflect self confidence to society, as positive attitude reflect peace and happiness. For example: When i have a positive atittude; i see more people want to know about me , but when i have a bad attitude nobody want to know me, because they know people with a positive attitude reflect more friendly, furthermore people with positive attitude have better relation with their family, friends and communitie as they energy is more pleasant.

A positive person with good attitude get more jobs. In some companies a positive attitude is a requirement for the employer. People who have a positive attitude do better works. for example: I am waitress and my boss say all the time "" if you want to be a good customer service you need to have a good attitude"" and thats true because when i have a good attitude with the costumers they give me a good tips, but when i have a bad attitude i get bad tips. Customers want a good service, employer want to make good money and companies want a good workers.

Some Schools want students with positive attitude. A student attitude is important because help them to get a better school opportunities. For example: Sports, Science, and others Team's in schools; the good attitude is a requirement if you want to be part of them. Students with a negative attitude have difficulties to connect with the class and work in a group. However, students with a good attitude facility they own work, and the teachers work, because if a student have a bad attitude is more difficult that teacher or coach teach them and help as student is good in those things, but have a bad attitude he/she loss the opportunitie to show their capacities.

People constantly keep trying to make them different, even the government is trying to tell them who they can love and who they can not love, who they can marry, and who they cant.

Expressing yourself in a world of 7 billion people is not easy, because everyone has different opinions and beliefs, you might have different ways to express yourself than your family and that is hard, because when you are young you believe in the same stuff your parents/family does, but the older you get you start to understand more stuff and why your parents believe in what they believe in.

Your own opinion matters do not let other people make you think your opinion does not matter or that it ain't important, you have the freedom of speech in the U.S., meaning you have the freedom to say anything you want to who you want in a whatever way you need to say or express it.

To be yourself in this world it's hard but do not let anybody ruin that for you, if your friend's do not agree on who you love, then change friends, if they do not like in what you believes are, explain to them your beliefs and try to make them understand why you believe in that certain stuff.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0
C2D061782462,"If you're afraid that you're going to hurt someone's feelings by telling the truth don't be afraid to tell that person the truth. Being honest can lead you to many benefits and help you in many ways right now and in the future too. When being honest, people will start trusting you with a lot of things. But you've got ot be careful with what you do or say. You can get a lot of good benefits in life. A benefit of telling the truth all the time is building new friendships and meeting new people.

On the other hand, people will have that mindset thinking that being honest is a bad thing. As you start lying more often, it can become a bad habit which you might regret later in life. Now if there's a case where you're trying to tell the truth, those same people that you have been lying too won't believe you. A negative effect that can ruin you is like losing friendships or losing a job based on the way you've been acting. Also, being dishonest can make people think that they can't trust you. Those people that you're lying too might think you're a bad person.

You can show integrity to lots of people which can be by listening to them and telling them the good and the bad. Think of yourself like a role model to other people and having a positive mindset. If you show integrity, people will start looking up to you. Also, have a good explanation to the reason why you're lying to that person, well that's if they find out one day. Besides, if you had a good reason for lying that other person might forgive you.

D2910C3C8E3B,"I agreed with Auther Ralph Waldo Emerson "" Unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" which is ture. Hard working pays you back!

Some people think they become rich by nature, every time knowledge need to upgrade ,and to keep our wealthy life need to work hard.

First reason, most of the time people think they become rich by nature. Which means they become well to do when they born. I personally do not support this idea because behind every success they is a hard working. For example United State of America is number one powerfull country in the world but, before America got that name their was a lots of scrifice. In my opinion If we dig the ground and we found the piece of gold that is not wealth that is a sign of destination, that means until we got the gold reservoir do not stop excavate.

Second reason, when a year change lots of thing change. For instant knowledge. Now adays tecnology descover the world. In this case every time knowledge need to upgrade. If you have degree in the filed of IT in 2016 and, still you did not upgrade your knowledge you are out of the game. The system or the caricullem is change so fast so we need to ajest our speed to run with the generation. If we need to grow what we have, we need to try somthong.

Inaddition, to keep our wealthy life we need to work hard. For example Bill Gate is wealthy man in America he have everything house,car and money. Bill gate does not say I have everything I do not need to work after this time. He is working hard like us. Because unless he did something to grow his wealth he will going to lose what he have. This is real life by any means if we stop trying we lose everything work, food, money, and family. The key is work hard do not Give Up.

In conclusion, we need to do somthing or try our best to live our wonderfull life. I strongly support Author Ralph Waldo idea. Dreams are not somthing to wait for; they are somthing to work for.

Which means works are the rode to get our dreams. Today is a great day to learn somthing new.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

Technology has had impacted us negative wise and positive wise. For a lot of people they see technology as a huge positive impact for people.

People may think now that technology is out people contact other people way less but high chance that's not the case. People that do things like gaming or just connection with others online make it way easier to meet other people. For example theres websites like Omegle where you just go on and get into a voice chat with a random person around the country or maybe in other countries. There's also many other websites or apps where you can contact random people or even friends and family. There's also gaming, for gamers you usually go into lobbies or servers with thousands of people which is also an easier to contact people. For example if you own a PC, a PlayStation, or even an Xbox there's many games where you can contact people if you're making new friends or even just playing with them for as long until someone gets off. I have heard many stories where people have met online and grew a friendship even though they've never met in person they probably have each other's social media and numbers.

Many people use technology to shop. Online shopping is an easier way of finding things you need or even things you want. People commonly do online shopping only because it's just easier and quicker. Some people may have a busy schedule so it will make things easier if they're running errands or even just going out and spending time with family or friends without having to add something else to their list of plans. Online shopping is probably something everyone has done multiple times and many people can agree that it is easier and quicker than driving out to the store and searching through the whole store to find the things you want or need.

In conclusion of this technology has made a positive impact in our lives in many things that people do on a daily basis. Technology could be seen as positive or negative depending on how people see it but in my eyes it's done a good job and has definitely made things easier for a lot of people.",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0

I think the best way to have a beneficial and efficient work is doing it in group. So, I have some facts that can convince you to think the same as me. This can benefit eveyone on the group because all can share ideas ,we can work in the difirents parts at the same time, they have more time on the breaks ,and they have more time to review the work and checks if there is a problem.

I notice doing in group is more efficient and can help improve the working on the on projects or works. First, I think that share ideas with the group will benefit you and all the group. So, they all can have ideas to continue and do not minds in blanc. This will be helpful for the groups because we are more efficient than do it separate. Also, I think this benefit every one on the group to do not get struggle because we are out of ideas.

I know that working in group is a benefit because every one in the group is having more breaks than they will have doing separate . Also , this help every one in the group because we are less probable to stress because we all have more times on the breaks to be relax. although, they can work in differents are of the work at the same time. So, every one working in different parts benefit they because they are working faster and efficient. I think we can get more time to help each other on the work and this is great because we learned and help the group to have a good work.

Every one doing this in group is a benefit and helpful way. So, doing this in group is helpful because every one can check differents part of the work and look if they find a mistake. Also, I think this is help because maybe a person did not see a mistake another one can see and can help fix it. I think all the group will benefit and we will notice the difference by working alone and working in group. Last, this benefi every one on the part they work because help about finding mstake and review if they something wrong.

I think doing a team work is good because every one can improve their skills or habilities . Also, this is helpful to every one to find mistake at tell where are the mistakes are and help us fix it to have a good work. at my point of view , every get experience working with people and sharing time with person to make a good work. So, this help by having more breaks than working alone, be less stress trying to finish the work ,

be more relax ,and be more concentrate in the work . In conclusion, this are facts and examples why working is group is more helpuf , efficient and benefit. ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5

If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. Student should always think first if a school offers you something.

My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldn't have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. My second reason is that its less cheaper. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. Students also receive free food from their home. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends.

In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school. I think online school is good for students. Why, because if a student that is having family problems, and missing school every day. They can take online school, so they don't fail a grade, or miss any important assignment.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

When a person have a bad impression about a class the first day because the class is bored; But the second day the class is fun your reaction can change. Some times the firsts impressions depends of your attitude because if your have a negative attitude your first impressions are negative too.

97C6E22BA8EE,"Working alone will always be a better progress to your knowledge. Some people think that is better to work in group than by yourself. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;that's why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy.

Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals.

Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life.

There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions.

Concluding with paragraph one,two and three,'' working alone would be the best fit to you to acomplish everything you want as long as you work for it,''. That is why I always try to work alone in all ways because it help to discover new things , a new person inside of you, but also it help to push yoursel forward and always do your best in every single thing that you do on your own because at the end of the way whatever you acomplish,''that is gonna be your legacy,''. If it were up to me , working alone would definitelly be the first option to people to take in a classroom or any place that you are working on.             ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

They will be discipline,and have respect of themselves and others example lets say you have a child is a minor and he or she breaks the laws and always gets in to trouble the military is one of things that will keep you discipline or otherwise they won't be well trained. The next thing I want to add is young people have to be shown and have experiences the a 10:pm weekend curfew is a descent amount of time to get them well trained other places like military, Juvenile, and like closing of businesses. Teenagers have a hard time staying in one place of a very long time with no free time a midnight curfew for teenagers is good for them so they can reflect and learn for their mistakes.

Some teenagers are committing crimes and getting away with it but this program well benefit them but in a matter time they will become good teenagers and obey the law. However, they will carry the behavior through their work place and public areas with good attitude and good behavior and it will never interfere of young person's live for example,lets say a job interview and the person who wants to hire you and he or she will see your characteristics and how many times you have broke the law and getting into trouble the person won't hire you can't get a job when you have a bad record of committing crimes and facing the law so, curfews are a good suggesting with young people that you can't say no to. However, another example is vandalizing when you harm someone's property without permission as an example like graffiti, braking car window's, and invading somebody else's property.

In conclusion, every teenager who brakes laws should attend to curfews for a beneficial life experiences so they can get the best out of them and they can prevent teenagers out of trouble.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

having a chance to meet new people, to know more about my classmates and even make new friends. I believe that working in group is more beneficial than working alone.

I think that having the opportunity to meet new people is really important. When I meet new people; I feel inspired, confident and happy. Because most of the time I like to share my ideas with other people. Although, not all time they will feel related to my ideas, but that's one way I make new friends by demonstrating my interest. I also like to hear peoples' ideas and stories. For example, I like to hear peoples' stories about their life and childhood.

I personally like to get good grades on school projects. I think that when I work in groups I feel more confident of what I am doing. I also do my work on time, and I even put an extra effort on my task to get a decent grade. For example, If I make a mistake my teammates will let me know. I will learn from my mistakes. If I make a mistake does not mean that I didn't try, I always try my best every day, to be a better person. So I can not complain that I do not have support because I do have it.

Some people say, that working in groups is not beneficial as working alone, people usually complain that they easily get distracted. But I think they are wrong. Because working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. When I work in groups I receive the support from my teammates. But when somebody is working alone they do not receive any support. So I think that working in groups is an easy and beneficial way to do my job and get a good grade.

When I work in group there's a lot a benefits I can get: I can meet new people, hear new stories from new people etc. If I get a school project and I have to choose whether to work alone or work in group, I will choose to work in a group without thinking twice.

Mistakes help you learn and get better and better until you understand the concept about what you are doing. Some people think that by making mistakes you will fail something, but notes that at the end you will get results from it.

Failure is just the key to keep looking forward in these world.

Some people stop where they are just because they fail on something, they think that they can not keep going forward just for a little mistake they have committed and they also give up.

81218F777A2F,"Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. At times we take advantage way too much. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. When you do not even use it half of the time. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money.

Second reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. Also will save resources that can be cleaned and used again. Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. Schools and other places should make an improvement and stop using alotof energy and resources and make it easier for the resources that are being used. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier.

Overall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. Reasons why is because teachers tend to use alot of paper to give students to work on. Most of the times teachers would not use front and back of the paper. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after. So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology.

There is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot.

Overall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. It would make the world a better place and more healthier. Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals . It is important to save energy an keep the world safe. Schools should just do everthing on computers and make things easier. Rather than wasting alot of materials for no good reasons.                                   ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
B3145EA3395B,"To see someone impression, that might be possible to chang. Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when they're in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me

""too mach agreement kills a chat"". Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them.

So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when she's sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and see's her like that they say that she's wired from how she acts, but her first imression was't like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and we're a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that she's very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how she's diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. To see people's impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some one's mind when they see some one impressions for the first time.

I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow people's impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation.

Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someone's story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. People's reactions might chang after an accident happen to some one's in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some one's reactions if we see them the next time or day. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. Emotions and there behavioral changes in some bodeis deppend on how they think by a word or emotinal apperance can be changed with their behavioras, and some might be in need so bad for somthing and that can also shows their impressions behavioral chang.

When I was in my country many people came to the area where we live there was so many that your mind can't relate to what we see and we all were very nice to them and we gave them many of the things that we have and as much we can, There was so many kids from them I use to be realy sad when I see them like that I refused to give every thing I can to them but some of them was vrery hungry and some are mean but I said to my self in my mind that their impreesion won't be like that if they weren't in need like that. So to see people impression we have to see thier past and what they been throw, Many of them change there mood, and some might change after a prolem has been solved.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0
A9544F0E8868,"First impressions always count no matter what and sometimes even impossible to change. Because,when meeting a new person or family member people judge on how people tend to act and speak. For example,if a women would like to apply for a new job and talked to the manager in a rudely manner her way of speaking and acting would affect her opportunity of working. So maybe think before what you're going to say because it affects your life. But,not only you but the others in the surrounding Therefore, being nice and kind to others helps the way people look and act when they show their first impressions to others.

First of all, first impressions not only are by judged by the person of a face but ,can sometimes leave a good mark or bad one because the way people look and the attitude they give. Sometimes that's why when people are going to give a first impression it has to be a clear and nice way so that the other gives back to people. Otherwise, when meeting with them later in the future they will regret to have spoken and talken to you because lack of behavior. So maybe think clearly andi treat others the way they do to others. Next time think of what positive things to share around and impressions to others.

Secondly, sometimes its impossible to change impressions and thats why we think before we speak. One way by noticing is when meeting a new person and by their first impression. Its says a lot by just looking at their behavior and attitude not only because the way they speak but interact with others. For example. when meeting a new employee at my job employees have to introduce themselves to each others so that they can create a long-lasting relationship. But, when meeting a new employee there was a guy and I introduced myself to him and he had just passed by without saying anything and was shocked when that happened.. Because, when meeting new people you have to introduce yourself to others like any other person in the world. Not only because their new but it helps people interact with each other.

Lastly, being able to give the first impression to others means a lot because it represents who you really are and the person you want to be. Therefore, people will comprehend the way you feel about others and how you treat them. So that your family and friends can be proud of who you are and realize who you've become as a person. Then, treat other with respect and kindness so that many others can spread positive things in life. maybe so later in life you can become someone and treat others the way you treat yourself. Then realize that first impressions always count as a good way to introduce yourself to others.

To summarize, the person who you are today is the person that can be later in life. Thats why first impressions always count no matter what and where you are and how you act as a person. Not only that but it also say a lot about people and you. Being kind and generous to others can affect the world by a lot not only by being kind but can help the people around you. Just by having a good impression of yourself people can take it to other good ways in life. So that's why we as persons have to be the that lead the next generation and with a good personality.",3.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0
3567E4ED2023,"One quote that is debated today is minister Winston Churchill success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I think that failure is one important thing to learn how to be. They feel has to do fast all the thing. I believe if you have goals you can be better very time. other reason is if you respect each another because that is everything you need.

Same people think if you do everything fast that going to be right but, you has to take slow. When you think failure is the right way because you learn new thing and going to help and everything you trying to do in your life. Another thing important from failure to failure is listing other person who try to help.

My option is if you trying to do many thing that same time is not going to work because you has many thing but, if take a moment is work. As you have read the best way from failure to failure is never give up because if you try many time that going to be much better because every person has mistake to be good in that way you lean you dont know how good you are in something you never has be try.",2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5
2ACFD4F32565,"Do you think a problem could change your life? Some people do think that a problem makes you go in the right way. But some people it's all made up to make you try. Therefore I

disagree with Duke Ellington because a problem could cause depression,lack of sleep, feeling bad. The meaning of problems is a chance for you to do you best is that problems help you do better.

Have you ever been through depression? Problems are bad because kids or even teens cannot control them . Next you need to stay away from conflict because conflict is problem and problem can be bad. After that depression is when you cannot yourself and you do wearied things like forget to eat or go to school. Another thing is depression happens when you are hurt and want to quit life. Also if you in depression talk to a trusted adult and he or she will help you.

Problems can also leave you to have some or no sleep. First that happens because your thinking about the problem and how can I get raid of it. Also you can raid of it doing something that you love to do like listen to something watch TV or even read a book. After that if it's a bad problem you will need to talk with a trusted adult. Another thing is that whatever it happens gust be calm and try to sleep and forget about it. In addition to that dont use your phone when your in that type of a problem and dont use phone before bed because you will be dreaming about it all night. At last have faith in yourself and dont give up in life because you can get raid of the problem and live a happy life, but dont forget to do something you like when your in a problem.

Don't feel bad when your in a problem because you can do it. First thing dont let other make fun of you being in a problem and gust try your best and you got it. Also feeling bad and looking at others could cause a bigger problem gust do your own thing. After that feeling bad abut something is not good gust be positive and worry about your self and dont let any boss you or making fun of you. Next problems could be bad but you need to talk to someone that your going through that and why are going through that. Then you can not feel bad and you will know what to d when you have a problem and hoe to slove it too. At last avoid any danger problem as much as you can.

In, concliontion I have come up with that what Duke Ellington is agreeable because some are long term problem and some short term, but there bad for your health and mental health and for you safety. Also you need to stay away from and type of dangers because dangers is like problem so stay away. After that tell a trusted adult when your going through something bad like conflict, dangers, and more. At last don't be affected to something to perfect your self.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
8CD4C142DCEF,"Why should you accomplish anything in your live? In another words, why should you finish anything in your live? You need to accomplishment to get your purpose. When you done something in your life you will be successful, not boring, and proud of yourself. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that, we have to accomplish in our life because when we will accomplish in our life we will get our goal, however, people might disagree with me, and they think that inactivity serve a purpose and that's not true.

It's a great thing to be successful in your live. "" Don't work hard but work smart"". In another words, you have to keep yourself working all the time. When you success in anything you feel comfortable. For example, In our school you have to do your work so you can success. when you let yourself finish the work you will be successful. Let yourself to be accomplishment in anything and you will be successful for ever.

When you keep yourself busy, you will never get board in your life. Being active all the time is healthy. Keep yourself working out, study, driving, eating, so you don't get board of your life. Always do anything to until you accomplished and do not leave it until you finished. For example, I go play soccer so I wouldn't get board in my life. If you don't want to get board, make your self create anything, keep your brain thinking in everything, play sports, believe in your self that you can accomplish anything in the world. Do not get lazy anytime because if you got idle you will not be an accomplish person in live.

Everyone will be proud of you when you accomplish something. You will be proud of yourself too that you accomplished something in your life. Always work hard so you can get a good grade and you will be proud of yourself. For example, I worked hard last year in World history and Geography and I passed the SOL, my dad and my mom both of them were proud of me and the whole family were proud of me, so you have to being working all the time.

In my opinion people accomplish when they always doing something . Always do your work and finished so you can success. Always work hard and keep yourself busy so you couldn't get boring. I know that some people will degree with me, but that's okay because everyone have different opinions, and my opinion was if you didn't work hard you will not get what you want. Let yourself work hard, so you can accomplish you work and success in your life. The best thing in life that you done work and proud of your work. Always accomplish your work and get it done so you can be a successful person.        ",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

For example, sometimes we as a person take bad decision that isn't favaroble for our life; but our guidance as our parents, mother or father give us advice to not take a wrong decision, and we have to follow their instructions because they're wiser than us, and they help us for our goods, so they don't see us ruining our life by ourself. Experts can show you how valuable its our life and how much we have to appreciate it. We as teenagers are not suficient mature to take a wise decision and mostly we as teenagers take the wrong path for not being wise enough or not having knowledge about how to take an important decision for our life without noticing how damage are our bad decision for us, and how much we can hurt ourself by not knowing how to handle it. Our decisions hurt people we love even though you don't want to hurt them because we let our impulse control us, and because of those decisions we hurt ourself and we hurt others by not realiazing that we push back our family and friends. Your decisions makes you grow as a person, but also make you find yourself, your decision are the ones that makes you be who will you be in the future, so you decide who you are gonna be.

And the things I like to do with them is making cartoons, painting and drawing pictures, and coloring, and writing novels. But, also last year I did art and took all art clubs ,and classes ,and usually I like to be a real cartoonist so this year I want to be a writer. And I want to do that for this year. But I am still good at it. So next year in ninth grade I am doing art again next year. And I use whenever I'm bored and there nothing I can do at home of at school.

So for writing I want to write novels and books for everybody. And lately I have been taking writing classes during the summer. But last year I started being a cartoonist and start writing newspapers and drawing cartoons for the newspapers. At School I join the animate club and then I started drawing pictures for the scenes of the cartoon. And I like it. So I join the yearbook club and I started writing the captions under the photos. To tell and say what it actually means. So last year for third block I had facs ,and I use art for the cakes and cupcakes and also ice cream. And then I think that art is good for me.

So let me tell about my favorite skill writing. The main I like writing is I like to write novels and books. But my favorite book I like to write is about Transformers Dark of the moon. My favorite graphic novel of all times and it is the number one movie to be produce of all times and in the beginning of the novel is the war of cybertron and the rest of the movie is all about everything about the space race. But the main thing I like about writing is you know is the words and feelings of it ,but also I like to write about poems , and poems help think about feeling.

And other kind of stuff let give you some specific reasons.

detail#1:

I think that writing can impress you detail#2:

Writing can also contain facts and opinions detail#3:

Writing can also have poems

So for art is everything

Art is everything

It can be all around us

And ,but also writing can have vocabulary and it is for spelling. But you must check your spelling whenever you are done with an article or an essay. And it also contains art. But also for art it shows like it graphic novels authors must make bubble speeches for the people it the book to say. Whenever they are happy, sad, or other kinds of feelings. But it contains all kinds of words and languages for people to say ,and the bold means what is important and what it really means. But it means whenever a person reads a book. And what it have to say what it self.

My conclusion is that in the future I continue to think about my talents and skills and what they really means to me. But still I think I still care about it. And that is for everyone else's. That is my favorite. For example I draw and write comics. That is my conclusion. The end",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5
